<p><em>2nd November</em>, 1922.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Belgrave</span>,</p>

<p class="ind4">When you begged me to write a “Foreword” for your
first book on Siwa, you asked me if I remembered you as a Junior
Officer in the British Camel Company at Khartoum in the early days
of the Great War—and later in the Camel Corps of the Frontier
Districts Administration of Egypt. My answer is that I remember you
well in both capacities, and I have a very happy recollection of
the excellent services rendered by both the units in which you
served. The appearance of British soldiers patrolling on camels up
the White and Blue Niles had the best possible effect in cementing
and consolidating the good relations existing between the Sudanese
populations and our troops and confirming that spirit of loyalty
and goodwill which, throughout the war, characterized the once
fanatical Dervishes of Mahdist times—a truly marvellous
transformation which had changed them from a fierce and ruthless
enemy into loyal and brave soldiers and peaceful inhabitants, who
were enabled to render the British cause wholehearted and ready
support at a most critical period of our history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>Your transfer to
the Frontier Districts Administration of Egypt also interests me,
for it may not be known to you that one of the first reforms I
instituted on my own transfer from the Governor-Generalship of the
Sudan to the High Commissionership of Egypt at the end of 1916 was
the organization of the new Administration to which you were
appointed.</p>

<p>Before our reconquest of the Sudan I had, as Director of
Military Intelligence in Egypt, some connection with the oases of
the Libyan Desert and the activities of the Senussi, as well as
with the government of the Sinai Peninsula. In those early days of
the British occupation of Egypt, Turkish rule prevailed in Tripoli,
and the actual frontier between that province and Egypt was often
in dispute—whilst a somewhat similar condition existed on Egypt’s
eastern frontier in Sinai. It was thought politically desirable at
that time to maintain the <em>status quo</em> and to avoid trouble
with the Turkish authorities to whom Egypt still owed a nominal
Suzerainty—that this was not always feasible is evidenced by the
celebrated “Akaba incident” which at one time threatened to disturb
the peace between the two countries. The preservation of the
<em>status quo</em> to which I refer, meant the maintenance on the
extreme eastern and western frontiers of Egypt of the purely
Egyptian administrative control which, owing to the almost total
absence of supervision, was of the lightest and could hardly be
designated as efficient. The necessity of inaugurating some
improvement in both directions<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_xv">[xv]</span> had frequently been mooted, but it was not
until the advent of the Great War and the military operations
against the Turks in Sinai, on the one hand, and against the
Senussi invasion of Egypt, on the other, that the long-postponed
reorganization became possible. By that time Italian had given
place to Turkish control in Tripoli, whilst it was also evident
that Palestine and Arabia were no longer to remain an integral
portion of the Turkish Empire.</p>

<p>These facts made it very desirable to establish a closer
Administrative Control in both directions, and it is to me a matter
of great satisfaction that an organization known as the Frontiers
District Administration materialized, under the able direction of
Colonel G. G. Hunter and his efficient staff of British and
Egyptian officers and officials, with its well-equipped Camel
Corps, its patrolling system, and its more intimate and sympathetic
government of the oases and of the somewhat unruly nomad tribes on
both western and eastern frontiers.</p>

<p>The mere fact that you, as one of these District Officers, have
been resident for nearly two years in the important, though remote
and little-known, Oasis of Siwa, and have been able to write a very
interesting and useful account of your experiences—together with an
admirable survey of its ancient, mediæval and recent history—its
customs, superstitions and its social life, is but one proof
amongst many others of the value of this new organization which, in
spite of the various political changes in Egypt, has, I hope, come
to stay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>As an ex-officer
and one who was lately in Egypt, you are wise to avoid in your book
all reference to recent political events and the complicated
situations to which they have given rise. In this letter I shall
observe a similar reticence, and the more so having regard to the
positions I have held in Egypt and the Sudan. Remarks on so
controversial a subject must be complete and detailed if they are
to assist the general public in forming a true estimate of the
“tangled skein” which the political situation now represents—a
situation in which truth and fiction are almost inextricably
involved.</p>

<p>The perusal of the proof sheets you have sent me, together with
your excellent series of illustrations (and here may I congratulate
you on the artistic skill of the charming sketches displayed in the
coloured reproductions?), recall that “lure of the desert” which is
so fascinating to all of us whose lot has been cast in those
countries bordering on the Great Nile waterway and the illimitable
stretches of sandy desert beyond. Your apt quotations at the
beginning of each chapter show that the “lure” has seized you also,
and I can well understand your desire to undertake further service
in those regions which so evidently attract you, and in which you
have won the sympathy and respect of the nomad Arab and sedentary
Berber tribes of the Western Desert.</p>

<p>The title of your book is well explained in Part I, Chapter III,
and you are wise to add a bibliography of the various works you
have consulted, for there is no subject more debatable than the
origin of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span>
Berber tribes of whom you write. “This crossing to Africa by the
Northern Mediterranean peoples,” says Professor Breasted in his
<em>History of Egypt</em>, “is but one of the many such ventures
which in prehistoric ages brought over the white race whom we know
as Libyans.” His remarks refer to events in the thirteenth century
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span>, when people known as the Tehenu
lived on the western borders of the Delta of Egypt, beyond them
were the Libyans, and still further to the west were the Meshwesh
or Maxyes of Herodotus—all of them doubtless ancestors of the great
Berber tribes of North Africa.</p>

<p>In the reign of the Pharaoh Mereneptah, the successor of Rameses
the Great, it appears that one Meryey, King of the Libyans, forced
the Tehenu to join him, and supported by roving bands of maritime
adventurers from the coast (the Sherden or Sardinians, the Sikeli,
natives of early Sicily, the Lysians and the Etruscans), invaded
Egypt. It is with these wandering marauders that the peoples of
Europe emerge for the first time upon the arena of history.</p>

<p>It is probable that not long before this invasion a great
Canaanite migration into Libya had taken place, for it is recorded
by the historian Procopius, a native of Cæsarea (565 <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span>), how the Hebrews, after quitting Egypt, attacked
Palestine from beyond Jordan under Joshua. After the capture of
Jericho they advanced westwards, drove out the Gergazites,
Jebusites and other tribes inhabiting the eastern shores of the
Mediterranean, and forced them to flee into Egypt, where they were
not allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</span>
settle, but were obliged to move westwards along the North African
coast and into the oases. There is also evidence that some of these
emigrants, under Roman pressure, were forced further westwards to
Morocco and were called Moors. Later on they, in their turn, were
followed by a similar migration of Jews from Palestine.</p>

<p>Thus it would appear that as far back as the thirteenth century
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> the original Libyans, a warlike race,
became co-mingled with maritime adventurers from Southern Europe,
with Canaanites, Jews and Egyptians—a truly wonderful admixture of
Asiatics, Africans and Europeans, and it is with the ancestors of
this international potpourri that you deal so interestingly when
you trace onwards, through the ages down to the present day, the
history of those desert nomads and those sedentary dwellers of the
Oasis of Jupiter Ammon. Surely your story will stimulate interest
not only in the archæologist, but in all who desire to trace the
manners, customs and characteristics of present-day peoples to
their original sources. Those Siwans of whom you make a special
study are of all people perhaps the most interesting, for, living,
as it were, on an island, in a sea of desert, they—like the
Abyssinians on the east—have been less affected by the
world-changes than those who inhabit the main highways of the great
African continent. The cult of Ammon and the seat of the Great
Oracle, it is true, brought countless hordes of strangers to that
mystic depression lying some seventy feet below the level of the
Mediterranean, but the leading characteristics of the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_xix">[xix]</span> inhabitants have probably
altered little, and religion—from Ammon worship to Islam, with an
occasional admixture of Christian, Jewish and Pagan rites (the last
brought by countless slaves from Central Africa)—has remained the
all-absorbing interest of these oases dwellers.</p>

<p>As you truly say, the origin of the branching-horned ram as the
fleshly symbol of the great God Ammon, “the King of the Gods,” “the
unrevealed,” “the hidden one,” still remains a mystery. We know
that the solar god Ra, whose supremacy in the “Old Kingdom” was so
marked, from the Fifth Dynasty onwards and was at its zenith in the
Twelfth Dynasty, became linked in the religion of the “Middle
Kingdom” with Ammon, hitherto an obscure local god of Thebes who
attained some prominence in the political rise of the city and was
called by the priests Ammon-Ra. His cult gradually spread over the
civilized world, and in the Roman period he was worshipped as
Jupiter Ammon. He was essentially the god of Oracles, but how he
came to have his special sanctuary in the Western Desert is still a
mystery, though your account of this in the legends of the Arabic
history of Siwa (Chapter III) throws an interesting light on the
subject. Herodotus, we know, gave to Siwa the name of Oasis
(probably derived from the Coptic word Ouahe, to dwell, from which
the Arabic Wa is derived)—that is to say a fertile spot surrounded
by desert, and thus from Siwa all other oases have derived their
names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[xx]</span>To Siwa then came
kings and wise men of the East, merchants and pilgrims, all
bringing offerings to the temple of the god and soliciting the
advice of the Oracle on their mundane affairs. For a thousand years
and more these treasures were accumulating, but where are they now?
As Egyptian research has yielded up unexpected buried treasure, may
not the ancient god still have something in reserve for the
archæologist and treasure-seeker who is bold enough to undertake
excavation work in the little village of Aghourmi, some two miles
east of Siwa, where the ruins of the Temple of Ammon still exist?
Your interesting account of these ruins and the legends you have so
sedulously culled from the Siwans, cannot fail again to create
interest in the hidden treasures of the desert. One who has had
some terrible experiences at the hands of the Senussi Arabs during
the war—I refer to the gallant and gifted author of that thrilling
story, <em>Prisoners of the Red Desert</em>, Captain
Gwatkin-Williams, R.N.—writes, “It may be that this twentieth
century of ours, this era of fish and bird men, may see lifted the
mystery which shrouds the hidden treasure of Ammon, the
‘Unrevealed,’ for, so far as our limited modern information goes,
those treasures have never yet been discovered.”</p>

<p>Your interesting account of the visit of Alexander the Great
(331 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>) to the Oracle, when, marching
along the coast to Matruh, he turned south and underwent great
hardships before reaching his destination, recalls a very different
journey I made to Sollum in 1917. Leaving Alexandria by
train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</span> for Behig, I
there found a fleet of armoured motorcars awaiting me, and the
journey to and from Sollum, then garrisoned by British troops, was
comfortably accomplished in four days. To my great regret I was too
pressed for time to be able to visit Siwa, where, “on all hands
springs of water gushed forth . . . that human ants’ nest,
fabricated for the most part of rock-salt, mud and palm trunks . .
. to which the Great War surging round the world had brought the
drone of aeroplanes, the hum of armoured cars and rattle of machine
guns.”</p>

<p>Your reference in Chapter V to the wonderful work carried on by
Miss Nina Baird amongst the bedouin women and children rendered
destitute in consequence of the Senussi invasion, recalls several
visits Lady Wingate and I made to Amria—the village in the desert
west of Alexandria and not far from Lake Mariut, where, as you say,
this courageous lady worked practically singlehanded in teaching
these desert waifs and strays to make carpets—thus starting an
industry and giving the women and children a means of livelihood
and a form of protection which for ever will be remembered with
gratitude by the Western Arabs. A daughter of that well-known and
greatly respected Scotsman, Sir Alexander Baird, an excellent
horsewoman, a good Arabic scholar, and one who performed important
services in the Egyptian troubles in the spring of 1919, Miss
Baird’s energetic efforts throughout the war utterly exhausted her
strength, and she fell an easy victim to typhoid soon after—to be
followed a few months later by her talented<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</span> father, and thus was the British
community in Egypt deprived of two valuable lives who had endeared
themselves to Europeans and natives alike and whose loss is
deplored by all. On my last visit the carpet-making industry was
about to be removed from Amria to an imposing structure built by
Captain Jennings Bramley at Behig, the headquarters of the Eastern
District of the Western Desert. Here this energetic official had
also constructed, out of the ruins of an old building, a
mediæval-looking stronghold, where we spent a few days and visited
the ruined church of St. Menas, to which you make a passing
reference in Chapter I. This buried Christian city is locally known
as Abu Menas, and for long defied discovery, as it had not occurred
to those in search of it to connect it with the Arab name of
Abumna, until the German explorer, Kauffmann, and his companion
lighted on the historic spot, which lies from fifty to fifty-five
miles south-west of Alexandria. Your readers may be interested to
know that Menas was an Egyptian in the Roman army who became a
Christian and took the opportunity of a great public function to
make an avowal of his faith which was proscribed under the Emperor
Diocletian. He was tortured and eventually beheaded. His friends
begged or stole his body, tied it on a camel and determined to
found a settlement wherever the camel should lie down. Menas before
death had expressed a wish to be buried near Lake Mariut, and here
surely enough the camel insisted on lying down, and could not be
induced to go further—so his<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</span> followers buried the body on the spot.
Many miracles were reported of his tomb, the settlement became a
large Christian city with a magnificent cathedral built of granite
from Assuan and marble from Italy. For some centuries the place
became a resort for pilgrimage from all parts of the near East, but
soon after the Arab conquest it was despoiled to provide material
for the mosques in Alexandria and Cairo. Gradually the ruins were
silted up with the ever-shifting sand, becoming mere mounds, and it
was the chance discovery of a small terra-cotta plaque imprinted
with the figure of Menas, standing erect with arms outstretched
between two kneeling camels and a rough inscription, that led Herr
Kauffmann and his friend to unearth the great basilica which had
contained the tomb. The walls of the cathedral appear to have been
lined with marble, whilst small pieces of mosaic on the floor give
the impression that the dome was probably adorned in the same way.
Some of the bases and capitals of the pillars are decorated after
the Greek style with acanthus leaf ornaments, others in the
stricter Roman method of straight panels. The dwelling-houses are
small and constructed in blocks separated by narrow streets. Not
far distant, on the coast, stand the ruins of Abusir (the Taposiris
Magna of the Romans) which was evidently used as a port of arrival
and departure by the thousands of pilgrims who came across the sea
to pay their vows in this hallowed sanctuary. When I visited this
place it was garrisoned by the very efficient Indian Camel Corps
which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</span>
Maharajah of Bikaner had sent as his contribution to the Egyptian
Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p>Your interesting sketch of the rise of the great Senussi, the
establishment of his now widespread confraternity and his invasion,
at the instigation of German and Turkish officers and officials, of
Egypt in 1915; his hostile occupation of the oases and the
successful campaign so ably directed by General Sir W. Peyton,
which finally drove his forces across the frontier and
re-established Egyptian domination in the Western Desert, merits
careful perusal if the reader wishes to understand the last of that
series of invasions from the West which began in the days of the
Pharaoh Mereneptah, nearly three thousand five hundred years ago,
and which, given favourable conditions, may yet be repeated.</p>

<p>All you so interestingly describe recalls my long connection
with the doings of the Confraternity when Sayed Mohammed el Mahdi,
the son of Sayed Ben Ali, the virtual founder of the order, was its
titular head. To him, in 1883, the Sudan Mahdi wrote, offering the
position of third Khalifa in his new hierarchy. Had Sayed Mohammed
accepted, it is possible that, in addition to the Sudan revolt, the
whole of North Africa might have been ablaze; but the Senussi Mahdi
aimed at peaceful penetration rather than military occupation: his
zawias (religious rest-houses) had gradually been extended to
Central and West Africa, they “were neutral meeting-places where
difficulties, tribal, commercial, legal or religious, could be
settled by an unbiassed authority. His akhwan were judges as well
as missionaries.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</span>
They defined tribal areas, settled water and grazing rights as well
as meting out the justice of the Koran to those who infringed the
code of Islam.”</p>

<p>The interest of the Turkish Government in this great movement
dates back many years, and I well remember when the late Ghazi
Mukhtar Pasha (then Turkish High Commissioner in Egypt) procured
the original manuscript Senussi prayer-book, had one thousand
copies lithographed in a private printing press in Cairo, and
dispatched them as a present to the Senussi with a request in the
title-page for the great religious leader’s “help in prayer.”</p>

<p>Sayed Mohammed died on the 1st June, 1902. I had full knowledge
of the dispatch to Kufara—the then headquarters of the Order—of his
tombstone which had been secretly cut and engraved in Cairo by an
expert native stonemason; but if I digress in this manner I shall
soon exceed the limits of a “Foreword,” and so must rapidly pass
over these early experiences which, nevertheless, proved useful
when the Great War let loose all the hidden forces of hostility and
revealed the immense influence of Islamic teaching for good or ill
as applied in the interests of the various opponents. That, on the
one hand, Sayed Ahmed, the uncle and successor of Sayed Mohammed,
should have espoused the Turco-German cause and harboured Enver
Pasha and other notable Turkish officers who had crossed to the
north coast of Africa in submarines, to organize the Senussi
campaigns against Egypt and the Sudan; whilst, on the other hand,
British influence and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</span> British officers were enabled to assist
the Sherif of Mecca—the Guardian of the Holy Places of Islam—in his
successful revolt against Turkish rule in Arabia, are interesting
and little-understood features in the history of the great world
upheaval from which we have but recently emerged, and no doubt they
will be chronicled in due course by those concerned in these
“side-shows,” as they are somewhat inadequately described. It must
not, however, be forgotten that—insignificant as they may appear in
comparison with the terrific clash of arms in Western Europe—they
have resulted in giving Egypt tranquillity on its western frontier,
in restoring to the Sudan the great lost province of Darfur, and in
freeing the Arabian Peninsula—results which in pre-war days would
have been characterized as epoch-making events, but which have
passed almost unnoticed in the great changes which have taken place
in the territorial redistributions of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>

<p>To touch on but one little-known detail, you refer to the Talbot
Mission. This has not attracted the attention it deserves, but I
venture to think history will credit Colonel Milo Talbot with no
mean achievement when it is realized that his mission effected the
triangular treaties between Great Britain, Italy and the present
head of the Senussi Confraternity, Sayed Mohammed el Idrisi,
whereby both Egypt and Tripoli have secured, let us hope, a trusted
ally.</p>

<p>Incidentally—through the good offices of Colonel Talbot’s able
Egyptian coadjutor, Hassanein Bey—<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</span> that intrepid lady, Rosita Forbes,
accompanied by the Bey, was enabled to penetrate to the Oasis of
Kufara in 1921. Another member of the Talbot Mission—Mr. Francis
Rodd—is also utilizing his experiences of the Senussi Confraternity
and the Western Desert by making a prolonged and important journey
with Mr. Buchanan from West Africa, which should throw much new and
interesting light on many still obscure localities.</p>

<p>In these days of improved communications—when the two ends of
the great iron road destined to connect South with North Africa are
gradually approaching one another, and when other railways are
either under construction or projected to connect the Atlantic with
the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea—the time may not be far distant
when the great Sahara and Libyan Deserts, too, will be traversed
from north to south and east to west, and the undoubted mineral
wealth and raw products of Central Africa will be brought to the
nearest ports for shipment to all parts of the world. Your remarks,
therefore, on mining, industries, trade and the means of
communication southwards from the Mediterranean through the oases
which you and others have visited, will doubtless prove of value
and merit careful consideration.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, much good work remains to be done by officers and
officials like yourself who take a keen interest in the welfare of
the sparse nomad and sedentary populations of these still remote
districts, fostering amongst them those feelings of confidence and
goodwill which will go far towards<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</span> preparing them for the advent of the
amenities of civilization which must come with the inevitable
development of the no longer Dark Continent. Now, however, that the
clash of arms is past and, let us hope, a new era of peaceful
development set in, I might well have prefaced my remarks with this
quotation:</p>

<p class="nind">The immortal poet’s words seem to me not only to
synchronize with the pleasantly conversational style of your own
narrative which has induced the somewhat novel method I have
adopted of writing you a letter by way of an introduction—but they
also express the spirit which will, I trust, animate us in our
present and future relations with those nations and peoples of the
Near East who unfortunately for themselves espoused our enemies’
cause in the Great War, but whose best interests lie—now and
henceforth—in the friendship and goodwill of the Allies.</p>

<p>Your chapters on the customs, superstitions and “fantasias” of
the Siwans recall much that is similar amongst the Sudan tribes and
peoples—especially those of the Moslem Faith—and your account of
the “zikr” is particularly interesting. In the words of an Islamic
writer, by means of this religious exercise “the whole world and
all its attractions disappears from the vision of the faithful
worshipper, and he is enabled to behold the excellence of the Most
High. Nothing must be<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_xxix">[xxix]</span> allowed to distract his attention from
its performance, and ultimately he attains by its medium a proper
conception of the Tauhid, or unity of God. . . . To enter Paradise
one must say after every prayer ‘God is Holy’ ten times, ‘Praised
be God’ ten times, and ‘God is great’ ten times.”</p>

<p>If the age of miracles has not gone for ever then these Moslem
devotees—the descendants of the ancient warriors of the Libyan
Desert, side by side with their courageous and resourceful British
helpers—may yet cause the great Oracle of Jupiter Ammon to reveal
the secrets of that old-time sanctuary with which your book deals
so interestingly.</p>

<p class="dcap">SIWA—pronounced “Seewah”—is a little-known oasis in
the Libyan Desert on the borders of Egypt and Tripoli. It lies 200
miles south of Sollum, the Egypt-Tripoli frontier port on the
Mediterranean coast, and almost 400 miles west of the Nile Valley.
Siwa is the northernmost oasis of a string of oases which stretch
from Egypt into the middle of Tripoli. These “Islands of the
Blessed”—as they were called by the ancients—are natural
depressions in the great Libyan table-land which are preserved from
the inroads of shifting sand by the high limestone cliffs that
surround them, and are made fertile and habitable by numbers of
sweet water springs. Siwa consists of a little group of oases in a
depression about 30 miles long and 6 miles wide, lying 72 feet
below the level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> of the
sea, surrounded by a vast barren table-land, parched and
featureless, where rain rarely falls, which can only be crossed if
one carries sufficient water for the whole journey.</p>

<p>Siwa is one of the least known and most interesting places in
North Africa, but owing to its inaccessibility very few Europeans
had visited it prior to the outbreak of the Great War. It has a
population of between three and four thousand inhabitants, who are
not Arabs but the remains of an older race, of Berber origin. They
have a language of their own, which is only spoken, not written,
and has survived among the dwellers of the oasis from many
centuries before the Arab invasion, owing to the remoteness of the
country and the slight communication between Siwa and the outer
world. At present the birth-rate is considerably lower than the
death-rate, so it appears likely that in course of time the Siwan
race will become extinct.</p>

<p>It was my fortune, after spending a year or so on the coast, to
be stationed at Siwa, during 1920-21, in command of a section of
the Frontier Districts Administration Camel Corps, and for some
time as the District Officer of the oasis. Under the present regime
there has been one British officer, seconded from the Army for
service under the Egyptian Government, posted alone in the Siwa
oasis. While I was there I spent my spare time in discovering as
much as possible about the history of the place, and the manners
and customs of this desert community, which differ very
considerably from those of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_3">[3]</span> Arabs or the people of Egypt. No history, from
its earliest times to the present day, has ever been written of
this strange place, and it appears probable that now, when British
officials are being withdrawn from Egypt, Siwa will once more sink
back into obscurity.</p>

<p>The oasis is most easily reached from Sollum, or from Matruh,
another port on the Mediterranean coast west of Alexandria. The
journey can be done in two days by car, when the rough desert track
that is called a road is in good order; it takes six days on a
trotting camel, and about ten days with a bedouin caravan of slow
walking camels. The Arab covers the whole distance on foot, living
on a surprisingly small quantity of dates, water and camel milk.
The desert is quite waterless, except for the first few miles,
where there are occasional rock cisterns which fill during the
rains and provide a little water during the first few months of the
hot weather.</p>

<p>The coastal belt of Western Egypt was comparatively unknown
country before the war, though by no means as remote as the inland
oases. Strangely enough, excepting the few officials of the
Egyptian Coastguards Administration, the Europeans who seemed to
know most about this country before the war were Germans, who were
encouraged by Abbas Helmi, the ex-Khedive, in their attempts to
exploit the commercial and agricultural possibilities of the coast.
In 1913 Herr Ewart Falls published a book called <em>Three Years in
the Libyan Desert</em> which was an account of some archæological
works carried out by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
him and his colleagues—Germans—on the site of the ancient city of
St. Menas, south-west of Alexandria. In this book he describes how
he accompanied the Khedive on his visit to Siwa in 1905. He gives a
flamboyant description of the Royal progress. The party consisted
of the Khedive, four Europeans, twenty soldiers, a number of
servants, 62 riding camels, horses, and 288 baggage camels, which
seem an incredibly large number. The Khedive drove the whole
way—200 miles—in a carriage, a species of phaeton, constantly
changing horses. Herr Falls mentions the intense enthusiasm of the
natives on the occasion of the Kaiser’s birthday, and discusses the
possibilities of a Pan-islamic rising against the much hated
English who “curtail the Khedive’s political activities.” He gives
statistics on the fighting forces of the Arabs, and considers that
the time is ripe for stirring up sedition. One of his theories is
that the Arab tribe “Senagra” originate from a German boy, called
Singer, who was wrecked on the coast. There is a photograph in his
book of one of the main streets in the old town of Siwa which he
calls “Interior of an ancient tomb”! It is really a very remarkable
book and gives one a good insight into German ideas in Egypt before
the war.</p>

<p>In ancient days the coast west of Alexandria was inhabited by
various Libyan tribes, the most famous being the Nasamonians, who
lived by the plunder of wrecks, and the Lotophagi, who are
immortalized in Tennyson’s famous poem “The Lotus-Eaters,” dwellers
of a land “In which it seemed always afternoon.”<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> These two tribes lived on the
coast that lies west of the present frontier. The coast which lies
between the present frontier and Alexandria was thinly populated by
wandering tribes of Libyans, a nomadic people, who depended, as the
bedouins do now, on the rains to feed their flocks. The inland
country was a land of mystery vaguely described as being the haunt
of strange wild beasts, although nowadays this waterless tract
nourishes few wild creatures of any description. In later times
Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines established some centres of
civilization on the coast, but this strip immediately west of
Alexandria was never thickly populated, and one finds few signs of
any former civilization. The Arabs, after planting Mohammedanism in
Egypt, continued their victorious course westward along the coast,
forcing their religion on the people at the point of the sword, or
driving the natives inland to the oases, which remained unconquered
till a later date. Thus, the Arabs of the desert have always
considered themselves to be the conquerors, and the oasis dwellers
to be the conquered.</p>

<p>The coastal belt from Alexandria to the sea slopes gently
upwards in strips of undulating country till it reaches the foot of
the ledge of the great Libyan plateau. This narrow strip of fairly
fertile country between the desert and the Mediterranean gradually
diminishes in width, from east to west, till at Sollum the cliffs
of the Libyan plateau reach the sea. At its widest part, near
Alexandria, the coastal belt stretches inland for nearly 40 miles
before merging into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
desert. The coast is inhabited by Arabs of the Awlad Ali tribe, who
move about with their flocks and camels from well to well, having
only a transitory interest in the soil, which they sow with a
little barley in the places where it will grow, and depending on
the rains, which are very heavy on the coast, to fill their wells
and cisterns, and to water the wild vegetation that feeds their
herds. The land is most fertile close to the sea, but for the first
10 or 20 miles on the high desert plateau above the cliffs there is
flat scrub-covered country that makes a good grazing-ground for
sheep and camels. Farther south one sees less vegetation, and very
soon the real desert begins, which stretches hard and dry under the
blazing sun for 200 miles down to Siwa, and beyond Siwa over
unexplored country till it reaches the distant Sudan.</p>

<p>As one goes farther west from Alexandria the country becomes
wilder and one sees fewer people, but there are several little
towns, or settlements, along the coast. The ex-Khedive had a
project of opening up this district and, aided by German
enterprise, he built a railway which was destined to connect
Alexandria with his western frontier at Sollum, and shorten the sea
journey from Europe to Egypt. But the line only got as far as Bir
Fuca, about 100 miles west of Alexandria. The Khedive found that
his agricultural experiments in the Western Desert were not a
success and, realizing this, he tried to sell the railway to a
German firm, but Lord Kitchener, who was then High
Commissioner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> stepped
in and secured it for Egypt. There is a motor road, known as the
Khedival Road, from Alexandria to beyond Matruh, and another road,
of very inferior quality, from Matruh to Sollum.</p>

<p>Mersa Matruh—Mersa means a harbour—a small town on the coast
about 200 miles west of Alexandria, is where the Governor of the
Western Desert has his headquarters. Matruh is the ancient
Parætonium, sometimes called Ammonia, and was the port for Siwa in
the days when that place was known as the oasis of Ammon. Matruh
consists of a few dozen little one-storied stone houses, plastered
and painted white, with gay shutters, yellow, green and blue,
inhabited by Greek colonists who do a thriving business by trading
with the Arabs, and exporting barley and sheep to Alexandria. There
is a picturesque mosque on the cliffs above the bay, whose minaret
forms a landmark for many miles, a hospital, police barracks, the
Governor’s house, and a number of Government offices and houses of
Government officials. There are large numbers of resident Arabs in
the neighbourhood who remain near Matruh, as it is the commercial
centre of the desert. At most times, especially in the summer,
Matruh is a singularly attractive little place, but when it is
visited by a “khamsin” wind, which blows up the fine white sand—and
this is not unfrequent—it becomes a more detestable spot than
anywhere else on the desert. The cliffs at Matruh suddenly cease
and are carried on by a reef of partly submerged jagged rocks which
protect the large harbour. The entrance—between two<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> rocks—is so narrow that only ships
of moderate size can pass, and when a heavy sea is running outside
the entrance is impassable. The bay is 1½ miles long and half a
mile wide, but in places where there are shoals the water is only 2
fathoms deep. To the east and west of the harbour there are a
series of lagoons separated from the sea by a line of low cliffs,
and divided from each other by narrow spits of sand. On the cliff
above the bay, commanding the entrance, there is an old ruined
Turkish fort, a yellow castellated building, which was occupied
during the war by a detachment of Royal Artillery. The houses are
on the southern shore, behind them there is a low rocky ridge
crowned with some little forts which were built during the Senussi
rising in 1916, when Matruh was for some time the British base. The
bay is surrounded by firm white sands sloping gently down to the
brilliantly coloured water. It is well sheltered and, consequently,
never very rough; the varying depths of the water cause it to
assume different colours—in some cases almost as brilliant as those
of the kingfishers who fly up and down the shore; at times it is
incredibly blue, so blue that the open sea outside looks black in
comparison, and at other times it is vividly green, with long
streaks of purple where the dark seaweed shows through the water.
Matruh is a pleasant place in summer-time, the bathing is ideal,
and the climate is cooler than Alexandria, which is the summer
resort of all Egypt. But the great disadvantage is the lack of
water; there are several wells, but the water in them<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> is of an indifferent quality, so
at present it is brought by boat from Alexandria, at great expense,
and pumped into tanks on the shore.</p>

<p>Some signs of former civilization are still visible, and it is
evident that the Romans, with their usual appreciation of beautiful
places, realized the attraction of this smooth, brilliant bay.
There are ruins of several villas on the banks of the lagoons, and
in places flights of steps have been cut through the rock leading
down to the water. The Governor’s bungalow is built on the site of
a villa that was once inhabited by Cleopatra. According to
tradition, Antony retired there after his defeat at Actium and
found solace in the embraces of Cleopatra. One can scarcely imagine
a more ideal spot than this for the site of the villa. It stood
among low sand-hills a few feet above the harbour, right on the
edge of the bay, so near that the rippling water must have sounded
through the marble halls of the villa. From the windows of the
present building one looks over the gorgeously blue bay to a line
of sharp black rocks where the white waves break, and beyond to the
deep blue open sea. At night, when the water shines silver in the
moonlight, and the little waves creep up the white shore and break
with phosphorescent splashes on the sands, one can easily picture
Antony and Cleopatra gliding smoothly in a boat through the
lagoons, which were connected by channels in those days, or
feasting superbly to the sound of</p>

</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>in
the villa above the bay. In the summer quantities of “Mex Lilies”
(Amaryllis) grow on the hills and scent the air with their heavy
perfume. A short time before the war an American archæologist made
some valuable finds among the foundations of Cleopatra’s villa, and
on several occasions coins have been unearthed in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The present-day Greek colonists of Matruh are not very
attractive people. They are very clever at their trade and seem to
become prosperous in a remarkably short time. They make their money
by squeezing the Arabs, who are forced to deal with them, as there
is nobody else from whom they can buy necessities such as tea,
sugar, rice, etc. The Greeks have the monopoly of trade and sell
their goods at a prohibitive price, quite out of proportion to
their worth, even considering the cost of transport. Their
favourite system is to buy whole crops of barley from the Arabs
before it is ripe, when the owner is particularly hard up. The
Administration, to a certain extent, is able to check excessive
profiteering, but there are innumerable ways in which the Greek is
able to “do” the Arab. It seems a pity, because, in my estimation,
the Arab is a much better man than the Greek trader. Not
unnaturally, Greeks are very unpopular. Farther along the coast, in
Tunis and Algeria, their place is taken by the Jews, but on the
Western Desert there are no Jews—so the Greeks have it all their
own way.</p>

<p>There are generally two or three English officials at Matruh,
and possibly their wives, so there is<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_11">[11]</span> usually more going on there than at any other
place on the coast; in fact, Matruh is a sort of metropolis of the
desert, but at the same time it is very much a desert station.
Lately, when I was staying there, there arrived one evening an
enormous new American car containing two English officers on leave,
and a very smartly dressed lady, wife of one of them. By amazing
good luck they had managed to get through from Alexandria without
mishap, stopping a night <em>en route</em>. On arrival at Matruh
they asked to be directed to the “Hotel,” which they had heard was
“small, but very clean and comfortable.” They looked exceedingly
blank when we told them there was no hotel—and never had been—but
they were conducted to the rest house, where they settled down.
Next day they complained that the rest house was neither clean nor
comfortable. The greatest disadvantage, to my mind, in all the rest
houses on the Western Desert is the multitude of fleas which
nothing that one can do is able to destroy or even keep under. This
car was not the kind used by the Administration on the desert; the
party had brought no spare parts for it, no servant, no provisions
except some biscuits and a tin or two of peaches, only a few glass
bottles of water, which were naturally almost boiling after some
hours in the heat of an August day, and none of them could speak
any Arabic. At dinner that night they all appeared in full evening
dress which they had brought with them, and, to everybody’s horror,
they announced their intention of “running down to Siwa” on the
next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> day. We
explained carefully that to reach Siwa they would have to cross 200
miles of waterless desert, and no car ever attempted the trip
alone. But nothing seemed to daunt them. Finally, however, the
Governor heard of their plan and forbade it forthwith; they started
off to Alexandria on the following day, with an escort of two cars,
and as they went they murmured indignantly about “red tape and
absurd restrictions.” It is amazing what a strange idea of the
desert some people seem to have.</p>

<p>Matruh is the centre of the sponge fishing industry which is
carried on during certain months of the year along the coast. The
sponge fishers are mostly Italians, and a fine-looking lot of men.
They have a little fleet of sailing-boats, and one steam-tug. The
boats put out for several days at a time, working up and down the
coast. They use no diving-bells, but when a man dives he holds on
to a heavy stone, which sinks rapidly; he makes a jab at the
sponges, cutting off one, and then lets go of the stone and rises
to the surface. Sometimes the men seem to bound out of the water
when they rise to the top. They are able to remain submerged for
several minutes. But the work tells on their health; they are
highly paid, but they say themselves that they usually die at about
forty, and there is always the horrid possibility of being attacked
by sharks, which are more plentiful in the Mediterranean than they
used to be before the war. At Sollum there are several graves of
sponge fishers who were killed in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_13">[13]</span> this way. I never bought a single sponge
myself during the whole time I was on the Western Desert. When I
was at Sollum I used to ride out along the shore with a syce
carrying a bag after every heavy storm and we would usually pick up
about a dozen first-class sponges worth about half a guinea each at
home. Fortunately, the Arabs had no use for such things as sponges.
One found pumice stone lying about the shore also. During the war
an enormous amount of wreckage was swept ashore and collected by
patrols of Camel Corps for building purposes and firewood.
Sometimes the whole coast would be littered with cotton from a
wrecked ship carrying cotton to Europe; another time we collected
stacks of good brown paper, which is still being used on the
Western Desert, and another time a number of casks of wine and rum
were picked up.</p>

<p>Between Matruh and Sollum there is a little place called Sidi
Barrani, which consists of a police barracks and a high gaunt
building which is a rest house and office, and about half a dozen
white bungalows belonging to Greek traders. Each of these places
has either a British officer or, if it is not sufficiently
important, an Egyptian mamur who is responsible for keeping order,
etc. Barrani is a desolate place, but very beautiful in springtime
when the country is ablaze with flowers and green budding corn.
Rest houses in Egypt and the Sudan correspond to the Dak Bungalows
in India. Those on the Western Desert are quite comfortably
furnished and well provided with plate and linen. An old
Sudanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> soldier
looks after each rest house. It is a relief after trekking along
the coast by car or camel to arrive at a place where everything is
ready and, in winter-time, to get a roof over one’s head, though
probably a leaky one.</p>

<p>Two roads run from Barrani to Sollum; one goes along the coast
among the strangely white sand-hills which are a feature of the
district, and the other, which is less liable to be flooded in
winter, is higher and farther inland. The country that one passes
on the upper road between Barrani and Sollum, between the blue
Mediterranean and the high rocky Scarp that runs parallel to the
sea, is very attractive, especially in the soft evening light. In
the heat of the day it looks dry and parched, except during a month
or two immediately after the rains. One meets very few travellers
on the narrow road that winds up and down, round low hills which
are covered with heathery undergrowth, and often topped with rough
stone cairns. Some places are very like a Scotch moor, or a stretch
of Dartmoor. There is a certain plant which is the colour of purple
heather, and another that looks from a distance like withered
bracken. In summer-time, especially on the lower road, one is
constantly deceived by the vivid mirage that hovers above some salt
swamps close to the white sand-hills on the shore.</p>

<p>Occasionally, one passes a party of Arabs, with their skirts
tucked high above the knees, stalking along behind their woolly
shuffling camels, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
perhaps one meets a patrol of Camel Corps, black Sudanese, in khaki
uniforms, trotting briskly along on fast riding camels; then an old
bedouin sheikh, wrapped in his long silk shawl, ambles past on his
Arab pony. Farther on, one smells the sharp sweet scent of burning
brushwood that comes from the fires outside the low black tents
where some Arabs are camping, and one can see them squatting round
the flame in the tent doors, with their white woollen cloaks pulled
over them, while in the distance a boy drives the camels and sheep
close up to the camp for the night. On the lower road, near the
shore, between Barrani and Sollum, there is a lonely little hill
crowned by a rough block-house where there used to be a detachment
of the Camel Corps. This place is called Bagbag and was used as a
frontier post before the war in Tripoli between the Italians and
the Turks. As one approaches Sollum the escarpment on the left
comes nearer, the foot-hills cease, and the road runs across a mile
or two of flat country within sound and sight of the sea right at
the foot of the towering cliffs. Before arriving at the camp the
road crosses several deep water-courses which come “from thymy
hills down to the sea-beat shore” through rocky ravines in the
Scarp; they are dry and sandy in summer, but during the rains they
become rushing torrents, quite impossible to cross in a car. Riding
home in the evening, one sees a number of twinkling fires in the
bedouin camp, and above them, sharply outlined against the
primrose-coloured sky, is the top of the great rocky<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> Scarp, like a dark wall that one
has to ascend before reaching the desert.</p>

<p>Sollum consists of about a score of little buildings, and a
large bedouin encampment, situated on the shore of a bay in an
angle made by the sea and the Scarp which rises to a height of over
600 feet immediately behind the camp, and juts out into the sea in
a rocky promontory. There are several wells at Sollum and one
little orchard of fig-trees which breaks the monotony of the
brown-coloured soil. Most of the buildings, including a large Camel
Corps barracks, were erected since the war. There are one or two
little shops, owned by Greeks, and a rough native café presided
over by an evil-looking, one-eyed Egyptian, who is also the barber
of the place. For a long time there was a British garrison, but
this was recently withdrawn, leaving a force of Camel Corps and a
small detachment of Light Cars in the old Turkish fort on the top
of the cliffs above the bay. At one time there were about a dozen
officers quartered here, and five or six of them had their wives
with them. Sollum became quite like an Indian hill station—perhaps
even worse, and when a certain elderly general, well known as a
misogynist, inspected the place, he stated in his report that there
were six officers’ wives and six different sets, the result being
that they were very shortly moved and replaced by unmarried
officers.</p>

<p>One gets to feel hemmed in at Sollum. On the north lies the sea,
and on the south and west rise the rocky cliffs of the Scarp. The
only open country is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
along the coast towards the east. A steep twisting motor road, like
a Swiss mountain pass, leads up the face of the cliff on the track
of an old Roman road, and several very precipitous paths ascend the
Scarp behind the camp to the high table-land above. But once one
has climbed the Scarp and reached the top there is a great flat
plain stretching out into the distance, which is good country for
riding, and full of hares and gazelle. This is the bedouins’
grazing ground, and every few miles one comes across great herds of
camel and sheep, and large camps of Arabs. There are a few rock
cisterns on the northern edge of the plateau and from these the
Arabs get their water. They often camp 10 or 15 miles away from a
well and send in a party of women and boys to fill the water-skins
every other day. Arabs seldom bathe, even when they are camped
close to the sea, but fortunately the sun is a wonderful
purifier.</p>

<p>The nomad Arabs of the Western Desert are a hardy, picturesque
race, very different from the fellahin of Egypt. Their active
open-air life makes them strong and healthy. Patriarchalism is a
dominant system among them; they are divided into a number of
tribes and sub-tribes, each under its own sheikh who is responsible
to the Government for the good behaviour of his people.</p>

<p>These tribal divisions breed factions, enmities and lifelong
feuds, which result in occasional raids and forays on neighbouring
tribes, and the carrying off of camels. Another source of dispute
are the rights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> and
ownerships of wells, which cause frequent fights, so a District
Officer on the coast needs to be well acquainted with the tribal
politics of the Arabs in his area. One of the greatest grievances
of the Arabs on the Egyptian side of the frontier is the fact that,
since the Senussi rebellion in 1916, they are not allowed to be in
possession of fire-arms, but their neighbours, over the border in
Tripoli, are under no such restrictions. The Arabs on the Egyptian
desert argue, quite rightly, that they are liable to suffer from
raids by the western Arabs who can dash across the frontier, drive
off a herd of camels, and retire again into Tripoli where they will
be safe from pursuit, as the Italians have very little influence
outside their coastal towns, and of course if anybody belonging to
the Egyptian Administration ventured across the frontier without an
invitation, and was caught, it might almost lead to international
complications. But the Egyptian Government considers that the
forces of the Administration are sufficient to keep order on the
frontier and protect the Arabs. (The situation is not dissimilar to
that in Ireland during 1920.)</p>

<p>The Arabs are a pastoral people. As the Siwans depend almost
entirely upon their date palms, so do the Arabs depend on their
camels and sheep, and to a lesser extent on the barley crop. Their
tents, called “kreish,” in which they live, are made of camel wool,
woven into long strips and fastened together, supported in the
middle by two poles about 6 feet high, sloping down to about 3
feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> above the
ground, with a movable fringe hung round the sides from the bottom
of the roof-piece. These tents are very comfortable, especially in
summer-time when the sides are kept open, propped up with short
poles. There is no furniture inside them, but the floor is covered
with matting and bedouin carpets, which are made of finely spun
wool, white sheep’s wool—sometimes dyed scarlet, brown, grey—yellow
camel’s wool, and black goat’s hair. They are woven in stripes and
geometrical designs, and ornamented with black and red tassels. The
largest tents are often 20 or 30 feet long and 10 feet wide,
sometimes divided into two parts by a striped Tripoli blanket which
is hung across the middle. One can be very comfortable in one of
these tents, with no furniture except a heap of carpets and
rugs.</p>

<p>Each bedouin has two sets of tents, a thin summer one, and a
thicker one which is used during the winter; the latter is lined
with a wonderful patchwork made from pieces of coloured cotton and
linen, like an old-fashioned patchwork quilt. When it rains the
wool of the roof swells and tightens, and the water slides off the
steep sides of the tent as it does from the proverbial duck’s back.
Being so low they are not torn up by the wind, and I have seen a
whole camp of army tents laid flat by a hurricane which tore many
of them to pieces, while the Arab ones remained standing and dry
within.</p>

<p>In appearance the Western Desert Arabs are fairer than the Arabs
of Arabia and Palestine. This<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_20">[20]</span> is probably due to the fact that when they
originally took the country it was occupied by Berbers, a
blue-eyed, fair-haired type, who are supposed to have crossed over
from Europe into Africa at some remote period several thousand
years ago. The Arabs are slightly darker than the Egyptians with
features that are distinctly Semitic, expressing more intelligence
than the fellahin. They are of a finer build and more wiry. Some of
the Arab women are very handsome, and their costume is particularly
becoming. They usually wear a long black robe with full sleeves,
but on special occasions the robe is of striped silk, and a red
woollen belt, several yards long, twisted round the waist like a
cummerbund. Their head-dress consists of a coloured silk
handkerchief tied tightly over the head, but allowing two coils of
braided hair to appear on both sides of the face, then, above this,
a long black scarf with a coloured fringe and a red and yellow
border twisted into a high head-dress, folded like a mediæval coif
below the chin, with the fringed ends hanging down behind. Soft
scarlet leather boots complete the costume. Almost all the women
tattoo their chins and often their foreheads with a blue pattern;
this is considered by them to be very ornamental, but to European
eyes it is singularly ugly. Old women dye their hair a brilliant
orange colour, and men sometimes tint the tips of their beards, as
well as their horses’ tails, with henna, presumably following what
one sees advertised as “The henna cult of beauty.”</p>

<p>As in most Eastern countries when an Arab<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_21">[21]</span> marries he pays “marriage money” to the
parents or guardians of the bride. So a daughter is a source of
riches to her parents if she is attractive enough to be worth a
handsome dowry. The amount varies on the Western Desert from about
five to a hundred pounds, according to the age, appearance and
position of the girl. Half is paid on marriage, and the remainder
is paid later by instalments, and it is liable to be forfeited if
the wife does not behave well, but if the husband divorces the wife
he must pay up the residue of the money to her parents. This makes
a man very careful in the choice of a wife. In many ways the plan
of buying a wife on the instalment system is a good one. Arabs have
more freedom in these matters than many other Orientals. Women are
not veiled, and men and girls have plenty of opportunities of
seeing each other, and even speaking together, before marriage,
though the actual negotiations are always carried out by a third
person representing each party. Arabs rarely have more than two
wives, though their religion allows them to have four, and divorce
is not so very common among them. The women have a certain amount
of influence which they exert without the men quite knowing it, but
although their position is better than that of the Egyptian women,
and infinitely better than that of Siwan women, they have a very
hard time. They weave wool and make tents and carpets; they milk
the flocks and make butter and cheese; they grind corn on rough
mill-stones for making bread; they fetch water, often from a well
many miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> distant;
and they collect wood every day for the camp fires; all this in
addition to looking after their children and cooking. Mohammedan
women of all classes are not expected to concern themselves with
religion; they are not allowed to enter mosques, except on one day
of the year, and during seven years in the Sudan and Egypt I only
twice saw a Mohammedan woman praying in public. There are very
definite social divisions among the Arabs, especially among their
women. The wives of respectable Arabs never associate with or speak
to women whose morals are considered doubtful. These ladies of the
<em>demi-monde</em> inhabit tents, generally on the outskirts of
the camps, and are conspicuous, as in every part of the world, by
the brilliant colours of their clothes, and their many
ornaments.</p>

<p>The Arabs are a kindly, hospitable people, not phlegmatic like
the fellahin, but easily moved. I had some very good friends among
them. When I was out on trek, if I came across an encampment, they
would see us from a long distance off and invariably come out and
invite me to dismount and rest awhile, and “fadhl” in their camp.
“Fadhl” is an untranslatable word which means roughly “Stop and
pass the time of day.” Sometimes I used to accept their hospitality
for a few hours in the heat of the day, and rest in a cool dark
tent, or wait talking in the tents in the evening while my men rode
on ahead and prepared my camp a little distance away. One could
never camp near bedouins, as their camels generally had mange,
which is very catching, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_23">[23]</span> their dogs were a nuisance at night, being
“snappers up of unconsidered trifles” in the way of food, etc., and
not always “unconsidered” either. These dogs are white or yellow
woolly creatures who guard the flocks with great apparent courage,
and attack any stranger, but when threatened they run yelping away
with their tails between their legs. When I dismounted I would wait
for a minute or so talking to the men, so as to give the Arabs a
chance to arrange things. Women would run frantically from tent to
tent carrying mats and carpets, and shooing away sheep and goats
and small brown children; then the sheikh would lead me to the
largest tent, spread with black and scarlet carpets, with probably
a long striped blanket hung across the centre and screening one
side of it. Or on warm summer nights the carpets were spread in
front of the tents, on the open desert under the stars. Unless I
specially asked to be excused the finest kid of the herd would be
caught and killed and an hour or so later it would be brought in,
boiled, on an enormous wooden dish, and I would be expected to eat
“heavily” of this, also of the “asida” that followed. Asida, a dish
which I always had the greatest difficulty in pretending to eat,
consists of lightly cooked flour dough, with a hole scooped in the
middle full of oil or melted fat and sugar, however, <em>de
gustibus non disputandum</em>. The sheikh, and perhaps one or two
of his relations, would join in the feast, watched with the
greatest interest by the ladies of the camp who would collect on
the other side of the curtain, and gaze firmly at<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> me from underneath it,
whispering, giggling and tinkling their bangles and ornaments as
they moved. If I knew the people well they would not bother about
hanging up a curtain, and women and children would creep into the
tent and sit staring from the far end, or carry on their usual
occupations—milking goats, spinning or making semna—but no woman
would ever eat in the presence of a man out of respect to him, and
a son would never think of sitting down and eating with his father
unless he was specially invited to do so. Generally the sons waited
on the party, and ate afterwards.</p>

<p>Semna is a kind of cheese made from goat’s milk. In the morning
the sheep and goats are milked into wooden bowls, the milk is
poured into a water-skin and rolled vigorously up and down by two
women seated on the ground till it thickens into a sort of butter.
The addition of a certain herb is needed if it is to be made into
cheese. One kind of white butter made by the Arabs is very good and
forms an excellent substitute for real butter, and a change from
the tinned species.</p>

<p>Arabs are very free in their conversation, and personal remarks
are not considered to be ill-mannered. They usually ask one’s age,
and inquire whether people are married or not. The idea of a man
being over twenty and still unmarried surprises them enormously;
they think that he can’t afford to buy a wife. They always show a
keen interest in what they consider the peculiar habits of
Europeans. Hardly any of them can read or write, and very
few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> have ever been
off the desert. When a bedouin gets to Alexandria he is like a
countryman in London. The bedouin are superstitious, but not as
intensely so as the oasis dwellers. In every tent one notices a
little bundle of charms hung on one of the tent poles to avert the
Evil Eye. One such collection would consist of a black cock’s leg,
a red rag, a dried frog, two bones, and a little leather charm,
tied together and hung on the pole.</p>

<p>One day I was sitting talking to some Arabs in a tent when
suddenly I realized that everybody was staring in a fascinated way
at my mouth. I wondered what was the matter. Then I heard the women
whispering to themselves: “He must be a very wealthy one; see how
he adorns himself with gold.” I couldn’t imagine what they meant as
I was only wearing a shirt, shorts and stockings, nothing very
remarkable in the way of clothes. Then I heard something about
“Gold tooth,” and I realized that their attention had been caught
by a hideous gold crown that had been put over one of my front
teeth in a great hurry just before I left Cairo the last time I was
on leave. They thought it a most attractive and novel form of
decoration.</p>

<p>When Arabs get money they either invest it in sheep and camels
or bury it in the ground. Some of these men who lead the most
primitive lives, living in a tent and feeding on a meagre diet of
milk, bread, rice and dates, are the owners of many thousands of
sheep and hundreds of camels. Sheep are generally worth two or
three pounds, and camels about fifteen<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_26">[26]</span> pounds each. Besides this, they often have a
little bag of gold buried somewhere in the desert. They never spend
their money on creature comforts, and the poorest and the richest
men live practically in the same way. My Sudanese Camel Corps men
used to criticize them, saying what a waste it seemed that they had
so much money, and apparently didn’t know how to enjoy it, whereas
in the Sudan when a man made money he would build a house, feed
better and live in a more comfortable way than his neighbours. An
Arab when he was “mabsout” (well off) didn’t seem to know how to be
“mabsout”—meaning also “happy.”</p>

<p>Once I was camped near some Arabs and one of them, an old
sheikh, was ill and considered by his relations likely to die. He
was known to possess some money buried somewhere in the
neighbourhood, and his relatives were most anxious that he should
not die until he had disclosed the hiding-place. But the old man
obstinately refused to tell them where it was. A deputation of his
heirs called on me and asked me to make him speak. I agreed that it
was unfortunate for them, but I could do nothing. When I suggested
that they should take him to the hospital at Sollum, they were
quite indignant and said that evidently Allah willed that he should
die; the only distressing thing was his obstinacy about the money.
This went on for several days, and then, to every one’s surprise,
the old gentleman suddenly recovered. Some of his relations seemed
sorry, and some relieved. When I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_27">[27]</span> last saw him he was watching a “fantasia”
which was being held in honour of his recovery, with a pleased,
benignant expression. Personally, I always had a faint idea that
the money never existed, but all his people firmly believe in it,
and he has kept the secret to this day.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw5">

<p class="cp1">A FALCONER OUTSIDE A BEDOUIN CAMP</p>

<p>One rather associates the idea of an Arab with his steed, a
wonderful fiery creature that skims across the desert like a bird.
The ponies on the Western Desert are a somewhat sorry collection.
Only a few of the well-to-do Arabs keep horses. They are small
hardy ponies very unlike the Arab steed of fiction. But they look
better when they are ridden, with their high scarlet saddles, great
iron stirrups and gaily tasselled bridles. The Arabs ride them
either at an uncomfortable jog trot or at a tearing gallop. They
have some curious ideas on the “points” of a pony; certain things
are considered lucky or unlucky; for instance, if a pony has white
stockings on both forelegs it is much esteemed, but a white
stocking on one fore and one hind leg is exceedingly unlucky. There
are many stretches of hard stony ground along the coast, so horses
have to be shod; this is done by covering the whole of the foot
with a flat piece of iron, and results in a terrific noise when
they gallop over stony ground.</p>

<p>There is very little sport to be had on this part of the desert.
The only form that the Arabs indulge in is the ancient pastime of
hawking. Certain men of each tribe are proficient in training and
hunting with hawks. Skill as a falconer seems to be hereditary
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> the same way as
snake charming, fortune telling and various other practices. The
Arabs prefer catching a full-grown bird and training it, to taking
a young bird from the nest, which would appear to be the easiest
plan. The method of trapping them is rather clever. When an Arab
wants to catch a hawk, he takes a pigeon, slightly clips its wings
to prevent its escape, and fastens a number of horsehair loops
round its body, then he releases the pigeon, which flutters away. A
hawk sights the pigeon, swoops down and becomes entangled in the
meshes of the horsehair, so that the Arab is able to run up and
secure it. The hawk takes many months to train. Gradually it
becomes accustomed to its master, who invariably feeds it himself,
and whistles when he gives it food in a way that it learns to know.
Later he takes the bird on his wrist, hooded, and fastened by a
leather thong; by degrees it becomes accustomed to his wrist and
then he carries it about with him, still hooded. Finally he removes
the hood and lets it tackle a hare or two which he brings to it,
then one day he takes it out on to the desert and looses it at a
running hare. The bird attacks the hare, brings it down, and sits
on its prey till the master arrives, or if it flies up he draws it
back by whistling and flinging a lump of meat into the air.
Sometimes an Arab will catch over a dozen hares in a day’s hawking,
but occasionally, after months of training, when he looses his bird
for the first time it will fly away and never return. One sees a
tethered hawk outside a tent in almost all the big encampments. A
well-trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> bird is
worth several pounds among the Arabs, and it is very difficult to
persuade them to part with one; they are used to catch pigeons,
quail and other birds, besides hares.</p>

<p>Another sport which we went in for along the coast was coursing
hares with Silugi dogs. These dogs are gazelle hounds and came
originally from Arabia. There are now a certain number of them in
Egypt, and all the officials on the Western Desert keep one or two.
Silugis are very similar to greyhounds, generally white or pale
coffee colour, with feathery tails and long-haired, silky ears.
They are very fast indeed, but have no sense of scent, and hunt
entirely by sight. They are rather delicate and very nervous, and
in most cases they show little affection for human beings. At
Matruh there was quite a pack which included a couple of
fox-hounds, silugis, several terriers—of sorts—and a few
nondescript bedouin pariahs. The Matruh pack specialized in foxes,
but at Sollum there were more hares than foxes. The desert hares
are rather smaller than the English ones, but they seemed to be
faster.</p>

<p>The open country above the Scarp stretches over alternate
patches of hard stony ground, and strips covered with low
vegetation where a certain plant that smells like thyme
predominates. Generally two or three of us went hunting together,
or if there were only two Englishmen we took a couple of Sudanese
syces or servants, who thoroughly enjoy all forms of hunting, all
mounted on ponies, and accompanied by four or five dogs. We rode in
extended order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> with
intervals of about thirty yards between each rider, the dogs
generally trotting along in front. Whoever raised a hare gave a
wild yell and galloped after it, “hell for leather,” the rest
following. The hounds would sight the hare and fling themselves in
pursuit. Quite often the hare got away before they saw it, or
managed to reach a bit of cover well ahead of the hounds, and then
they would slacken down, at a loss, and wait till the riders came
up and scoured the country round to put up the hare again. It
sounds rather unsporting, but the hare stood a very good chance; in
fact, generally more than half of them got away, and it gave one
some splendid long gallops across the country. Sometimes we would
raise a gazelle, and give chase, but few dogs or ponies can catch
up a gazelle when it gets a little start and is really moving. I
think the scale of speed was, gazelle, silugi, hare and ponies. It
was a primitive form of hunting, but one liked it none the less,
and jugged hare made a welcome change in the menu.</p>

<p>There were a certain number of gazelle on the desert quite close
to the top of the Scarp and it was occasionally possible to get a
shot at them, but they were very shy, and needed careful stalking
over country that was almost without cover. When anybody went out
specially to shoot gazelle none would appear, but when riding along
on a camel one saw numbers of them; however, by the time one had
dismounted and loaded the gazelle would be out of range, probably
standing a long distance away “at gaze.” Gazelle do not mind camels
if they have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
people on them, and the Arabs sometimes get quite close to a
gazelle by stalking it from among a number of grazing camels. At
one time, after the war, the men of the Light Car Patrols took to
hunting gazelle in Ford cars with a machine-gun; fortunately this
practice was forbidden, but it scared the gazelle from the
neighbourhood for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Numbers of rock pigeons nested among the cliffs on the coast,
and quantities of them collected round the camel lines and fed off
the refuse grain. In the autumn thousands of quail arrived on the
coast from Europe; they were often so exhausted that the Arab boys
could catch them in their hands. The natives netted them for sale
to the Greeks, who exported them alive in crates to Alexandria. One
got very tired of eating quail during the month or two that they
were in season; still, at first they were extremely good. Among the
wadis in the Scarp there were occasional coveys of red-legged
partridge, and lately there have been a few sand-grouse about the
high country; once or twice I have seen duck on the marshes near
the sea, and an occasional bustard, but, on the whole, there was
very little to be had in the way of shooting.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw5">
<figure id="i05"><img src='images/i05.jpg' alt=''>
<p class="cp1">SILUGI HOUNDS</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>A number of jackals and a few wild cats lived in the caves among
the wadis in the Scarp. Their mournful wailings echoed through the
rocky ravines, and owing to its eeriness at night the bedouins
thought that it was haunted by evil spirits. But in the daytime
they climbed about it quite unconcernedly, and their goats snatched
a scanty pasturage among<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_32">[32]</span> the rocks. During most of the year the Scarp
looks harsh and forbidding, but after the rains a change comes over
it; one notices a faint green tinge about the cliffs, and a closer
examination shows that it is covered with blossoming flowers and
rock plants. The slopes become gay with mauve, pink, yellow and
blue flowers, saltworts, samphires, sea lavender, yellow nettle,
campanulas, little irises, marigolds, ranunculas, Spanish broom,
masses of night-scented stock and a quantity of other little
flowering plants which clothe the grim rocks in a robe of brilliant
colour. The flat country, too, blossoms out into colour. One sees
scarlet poppies, mallows, and tall scabious among the budding corn,
and fields of swaying asphodel, and the whole desert is scented in
the evening by the night-scented stock.</p>

<p>The rain that causes this transformation falls occasionally
during the winter months from November till about March. During
this time there are clouds in the sky, and sometimes terrific
downpours. The Arabs greet the first rain of the season with great
delight, the men sing and shout, and the women raise piercing
shrieks to show their pleasure. Unless there is a good rainfall
none of the barley grows, and the grazing on which the sheep and
camels depend is insufficient. When it rains the wadis become
rushing torrents, roads are impassable, every house leaks, and many
of the roofs subside. The camels have to be led from their flooded
lines to the higher ground where they stand shivering. Camels hate
rain. If one is out on trek and a really stiff<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_33">[33]</span> shower comes on the camels barrack down,
with their backs towards the direction of the rain, and nothing
will make them budge till it is over. One just has to wait till it
stops. If the track is muddy and wet the camels slither and slide
and one must dismount and lead them; they were made for hot, dry
countries, not for a damp, wet climate. Hardly any of the houses at
Matruh or Sollum are watertight, and it was nothing out of the
ordinary when one called on a man to find him camped out in the
middle of his most watertight room, surrounded by his perishable
belongings, with a sort of canopy consisting of a waterproof sheet
and a mackintosh or two stretched out above him. But though rain
storms were very violent they did not last long, and the sun soon
came out and dried everything up again. When, however, one was
caught by a bad storm out on trek on the desert, with only a thin
tent, and no change of clothes, it was very disagreeable.</p>

<p>The word “house” is misleading. People imagine at least a large
comfortable bungalow. But on the Western Desert the average house
occupied by an English official, with possibly a wife, was a
three-roomed stone hut, with plastered walls and a wooden roof,
with a very thin layer of cement. The largest room would be about
twelve feet square, the plaster invariably crumbled off the walls
owing to the salt in it, and the cement invariably cracked in the
summer so that the rain poured through the roof in the winter.
Cement for some reason was almost impossible to get. One always
heard that for “next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
year” the Administration had included the building of real houses
for its officials in the Budget, but this item was always one of
the first to be struck out on the grounds of economy. Nobody has
yet discovered an ideal roofing for the Western Desert, where there
are extremes of heat and cold and occasional terrific hurricanes
and downpours. So far, the best type of abode seems to be the
bedouin tent.</p>

<p>One of the chief events on the coast was the arrival of the
cruiser, <em>Abdel Moneim</em>, which came up from Alexandria about
once every fortnight or three weeks bringing mails, supplies and
sometimes high officials on tours of inspection. She spent a day or
two in harbour at Matruh and Sollum on each trip. This little
cruiser was built in Scotland for the Egyptian Government, and with
two other boats comprises the navy of Egypt. She was a neat-looking
grey ship, always very spick and span with fresh paint and shining
brass, manned by a crew of Egyptians in white or blue sailors’
uniform and red tarbooshes. Her captain was an English bimbashi in
the Egyptian Coastguards Administration, whose uniform was somewhat
confusing, as he wore, besides the naval rank on his sleeve, a
crown and star on his shoulder. The cruiser was carefully built so
as to allow a spacious saloon and two state cabins, for the
accommodation of the Director-General. Two machine-guns were posted
fore and aft. The <em>Abdel Moneim</em> had the well-deserved
reputation of being warranted to make the very best sailor seasick,
even in comparatively calm weather. She<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_35">[35]</span> rolled and pitched simultaneously in a more
horrid manner than any ship I have ever known. The result was that,
when people went down the coast to Alexandria on leave, they
arrived in Egypt looking and feeling like nothing on earth, and
spent the first few days of their all too short leave recovering
from the evil after-effects of the voyage. I have never yet met
anyone who really enjoyed a trip on the cruiser. Personally, the
only time that I felt comfortable on board was when we were firmly
moored to the quay at Matruh or Sollum. When the high officials
landed after a sea trip they were generally feeling so ill that
their visits were not entirely a pleasure to the people who were
being inspected.</p>

<p>Occasionally misguided individuals, who knew nothing about it,
got permission to go up to Sollum and back by cruiser, hoping for a
pleasant little trip on the Mediterranean. Generally, when they
arrived at Matruh, they inquired anxiously whether it was possible
to return to Alexandria by car, or even by camel. Some queer
visitors sometimes came on these “joy rides,” but very little joy
was left in them by the time they reached Sollum. On one occasion,
a Mr. B. of the Labour Corps, a Board School master in private
life, arrived by cruiser at Matruh. He announced that he had come
to study the coast and the Arabs. He was just the type that Kipling
describes so well in his poems. The Governor invited him to lunch;
he arrived in spurs, belt, etc., though it was the summer and every
one else was wearing the fewest and thinnest clothes;
however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> that may
have been politeness. There happened to be three or four other men
present. At lunch Mr. B. proceeded to air his views on how the
desert should be run; we heard some startling facts about it; he
disapproved of the Administration, and told us so; he then
proceeded to tell us about the Sudan, as he had lately spent one
week in an hotel at Khartoum. The Governor had been recently
transferred from the Sudan, where he had been Governor of one of
the largest provinces, and as it happened every single man present
had served there for some considerable time, so, naturally, we were
interested to be told a few facts about it!</p>

<p>A couple of days later I happened to go down the coast with Mr.
B. and a certain District Officer. The latter spent his whole time,
when he wasn’t ill, telling Mr. B. the most outrageously impossible
stories of camels, Arabs and the desert, which he swallowed
unblinkingly and noted down in a copybook in order to give
lectures, so he told us, at his club when he returned home. That
club must have heard some startling stories. One of the facts—or
fictions—that interested him particularly was a description of
“watch camels which are posted by the Arabs round their flocks and
when a stranger appears they gallop across to the camp and warn
their masters.” Another very vivid story was the description of a
whole herd of camels going mad from hydrophobia. It is wonderful
how credulous some people can be, but I think he deserved it.</p>

<p class="dcap">THE Western Desert of Egypt is regulated by the
Frontier Districts Administration, a comparatively new department
of the Egyptian Government which was formed during the war and took
over many of the duties of the old Egyptian Coastguards
Administration. The F.D.A. is a military Administration with
British officers, and is responsible for the Western Desert, Sinai
and the country between the Red Sea coast and the Nile. In each of
these provinces there is a Governor and several District Officers
and officers of the Camel Corps. The Military Administrator at the
head of the whole Administration is Colonel G. G. Hunter, C.B.,
C.M.G., and the Governor of the Western Desert is at present
Colonel M. S. Macdonnell. The forces of the F.D.A. consist of a
Sudanese Camel Corps and local police.</p>

<p>On the Western Desert there is one company of Camel Corps, about
170 strong, divided into three<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_38">[38]</span> sections, of which two are stationed on the
coast and one in the Siwa oasis. The duties of the Camel Corps are
practically those of mounted police, patrolling the coast and
frontier, preventing smuggling and gun running, and keeping order
among the Arabs in case of any disturbance or trouble. But since
the successful termination of the British operations against the
Senussi in 1917 the Western Desert has been very peaceable, and the
Arabs seem to be thoroughly satisfied with the organization by
which they are now governed. During all the trouble in Egypt in
1919-21, when the country was seething with anti-British
agitations, there were absolutely no disturbances or demonstrations
among the Arabs of the Western Desert, and I have heard them in
their tents discussing, quite genuinely, the foolishness of the
goings-on in Egypt.</p>

<p>The F.D.A. Camel Corps was originally formed of Sudanese men
from the Coastguard Camel Corps, with a large proportion of “yellow
bellies” (Egyptians) who were gradually weeded out and replaced by
Sudanese and Sudan Arabs, who were enlisted on the borders of
Egypt, as the Sudan Government does not allow recruiting inside its
territories except for the Egyptian Army. The F.D.A. Camel Corps is
supposed to consist entirely of Sudanese, but a certain number of
the men who were enlisted in the regions of Luxor and Kom Ombo are
not real Sudanis. They are very well paid, provided with good
uniforms and rations, and a certain percentage are allowed to have
their wives with them on the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_39">[39]</span> coast. Every camp has its “harimat”—married
quarters—where the married men and their families live. But before
a man is allowed to marry he has to pass a test in musketry. Many
of the men marry Arab women, and this sometimes caused considerable
trouble among the Sudanese wives, who are by no means fond of their
Arab “sisters.” As they all live close together in rather cramped
quarters they have a very lively time. One’s office hours are often
occupied in endeavouring to pacify some irate old Sudanese lady who
brings a furious complaint that the Arab wife of her next-door
neighbour is “carrying on” with her husband. Or one gets a long
involved case like the following story to inquire into, generally
when there is a great deal of other work to be done.</p>

<p>Ombashi (corporal) Suliman Hassan married an Arab lady called
Halima bint—daughter of—Ahmed Abu Taleb; when she married her
father gave her an old primus stove, a favourite possession of the
Arabs at Sollum, which he had bought from the servant of one of the
English officers—this incidentally caused another inquiry. The
marriage was not a success, and after six months of unhappy married
life Ombashi Suliman divorced his wife. Apparently he “celebrated”
the divorce “not wisely but too well,” because on the next day he
got a month’s hard labour for being drunk on duty. He took the
primus with him when he went to prison. Halima retired to Bagbag
with her goods and chattels, and after a suitable interval she
married another Camel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Corps man, this time a “naffer”—private—who brought her back with
him to Sollum.</p>

<p>Ombashi Suliman had also consoled himself, and presented the
primus stove, now very worn and shaky, to his new wife, a buxom
Sudanese. She sold it to her married sister. It exploded and set a
tent on fire; so the sister gave it to her little girl Zumzum, a
small black infant with tight curls and one pink garment. Then one
day Halima saw the primus, her primus, in the hands of the small
Zumzum, and remembered about it. She rushed home to her new husband
and stirred him to action; so he arrived at my office with a long
incoherent complaint, demanding justice and the return of the
stove.</p>

<p>I had to spend an entire morning unravelling this history and
examining endless witnesses, who all wished to talk about any
subject except the one I was getting at. When the present wife and
the divorced wife of Ombashi Suliman met outside the office they
were with difficulty restrained from fighting, and the lurid
details which were wafted through the window, about the lives and
antecedents of both ladies, were interesting, but quite
unprintable. Eventually the small Zumzum, now in a state of
inaudible terror, produced the primus, which was found to be worn
out, irreparable, and absolutely useless.</p>

<p>One of the features of Sollum is a little cluster of tents and
huts, near the Camel Corps Camp, which is known as the “Booza
Camp.” It is run by about a dozen elderly Sudanese widows and
divorcees who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
manufacture “marissa,” a drink made from barley. The men are
allowed here at certain times and on holidays, as marissa is not
permitted to be brewed in the camp. The wives have the strongest
objection to this institution which attracts their husbands away
from home, as a public-house does in England, though the dusky
barmaids could not possibly be called attractive. One can rightly
say of the Sudanese that their favourite diversions are wine, women
and song.</p>

<p>The Sudanis of the Camel Corps are a very likeable lot. They are
thoroughly sporting and have a strong sense of humour, but in many
ways they are very like children. They have an aptitude for drill
and soldiering, but are useless without British officers owing to
their lack of initiative. They are faithful and become very
attached to Englishmen, but they have a keen sense of
discrimination. Like all native troops there is a tendency for each
man to consider himself a born leader, and offer his advice and
opinion on all occasions; this takes a long time to subdue. But
with careful training they become efficient soldiers, and they look
very smart in their khaki uniform, which is rather similar to an
Indian’s. Physically many of them are splendid men, very powerful
and muscular, like bronze statues, but although the climate of
their own country is intensely hot they are by no means immune from
the effects of sun, and they seem to be almost more liable to catch
fever than an Englishman.</p>

<p>The three sections take it in turns to go to Siwa,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> where they generally remain from
six to nine months. It is not a popular place, in spite of the fact
that every man is allowed to marry, with no restrictions, such as
first having to pass a musketry test. The men much prefer being on
the coast where there is more going on, as they are at heart
intensely sociable, and also, though living is cheap at Siwa, the
climate has a bad reputation.</p>

<p>The best time to go to Siwa is in the spring, when the weather
is cool and there is probably water on the road. The trip needs a
good deal of preparing for, especially as one has to take down
stores for many months. A camel patrol from Siwa used to meet a
patrol from the coast at the half-way point on the road once every
month, and in this way the mails were sent down to the oasis. A car
patrol was supposed to go down at certain intervals, but they were
very irregular, and sometimes, on the few occasions when they did
come, they forgot to bring the mail. One depended so much on
letters at Siwa that this was an intense disappointment. The
following is a rough diary of a trek down to Siwa in the hot
weather.</p>

<p class="nind space-above15 space-below1"><em>Saturday, July
24th.</em>
</p>

<p>Spent a busy morning making final arrangements for the trip and
seeing that everything was ready. We moved off from Sollum at 3.30
p.m., myself, 39 men, 50 camels, and one dog. The whole camp turned
out to see us off, including many small black babies belonging to
the men. Some of the men wept<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_43">[43]</span> profusely at parting with their wives, but
almost before we were out of Sollum I heard them gaily discussing
which of the Siwan ladies they would honour by marriage. Saturday
is a fortunate day to start on a journey. Apparently the prophet
Mohammed favoured Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, but Saturdays
most of all. Another good omen was the appearance of two crows
which we passed just outside the camp; a single crow would have
been cause for anxiety, and to see a running hare before camping at
night is considered a very serious piece of ill-luck. I think this
started from the idea that a running hare was a sign of people on
the move close at hand, probably enemies.</p>

<p>We marched along the bottom of the Scarp and reached Bir
Augerin, where we camped for the night, at sunset. At Augerin there
is one of the many rock cisterns that one finds on the coast. These
cisterns are large rectangular underground tanks, often 40 feet
square and 20 feet high, with one or two square holes in the roof
large enough to admit a man. The Arabs draw the water up in leather
buckets on the end of a rope, or if the supply is low one man goes
down and fills the bucket which is drawn up by the man above. They
are always built in the middle of a hollow with several stone
runnels that carry the rain water down from the higher ground.
Generally there is a mound near the well with a sheikh’s tomb on
the top of it, a cairn surrounded by a low wall, ornamented with a
few little white flags which are contributed by passing travellers
as a thank-offering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
for the water. According to M. Maspero, the cisterns along the
coast were built by the Romans in the second century A.D., and were
in use until the middle or end of the fourth century. Most of them
are now so out of repair that they only hold water for a very short
time after the rains have ceased, and when they are dry they become
the home of snakes, bats and owls; however, I believe it is
proposed to restore several of the most useful of them.</p>

<p>We camped near the well at Augerin. I had an indifferent dinner.
My new cook, Abdel Aziz, seems to be a fool and unaccustomed to
being on trek. He is a Berberin, a despised “gins”—race—but always
considered to be good cooks. The men I have got with me are a fine
lot, all “blacks” and mostly “Shaigis”—from the North Sudan. The
old Bash-Shawish—sergeant-major—was previously in the Coastguards
and knows the country well. I did not bother to put up a tent, but
slept in the open under the stars, which were gorgeous. Not a very
hot night.</p>

<p class="nind space-above15 space-below1"><em>25th.</em>
</p>

<p>Moved off at 4.30 a.m. by chilly but brilliant moonlight. Led
the camels and walked for the first hour, then mounted and rode.
The men made a long line riding along in file. Arrived at Bir
Hamed, another cistern, at about 8 a.m. We stay here till to-morrow
morning in order to give the camels a good day’s grazing and
watering, as this is the last well before<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_45">[45]</span> the real desert. Bir Hamed is a very wild,
picturesque place among the rocky foot-hills below the Scarp. In
the spring it becomes one mass of flowers, but now it looks dry and
barren. The camels drank frantically and then went out to graze.
There is still a fair amount of water in the well, which is icy
cold and very refreshing. I, and almost all the men, had a bath, as
it is the last opportunity till we get to Siwa. I spent a lazy day
in my tent and the men slept most of the time. At four o’clock the
camels were driven in to drink again, this time they were less
eager to get to the water and sipped it in a mincing way like an
affected old lady drinking tea.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw5">
<figure id="i06"><img src='images/i06.jpg' alt=''>
<p class="cp1">CAMEL CORPS</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>After dinner, when I was sitting outside my tent in the
moonlight, I heard a faint sound of shouting in the distance. I
took a couple of men and walked in the direction the sound came
from. About a mile from the camp we sighted a large number of black
Arab tents that showed up clear in the moonlight on a slight rise
in the ground. There had been a marriage in the tribe and the
festivities were being concluded by a dance.</p>

<p>Two girls were slowly revolving round in the centre of an
enormous circle of white-robed bedouins each holding in her hand,
above her head, a long cane which she flourished in the manner that
a dancer uses a bouquet of flowers. The girls wore the usual Arab
dress, the black, long-sleeved robe and scarlet waist-band, but
their faces were hidden by long black veils, and they wore white
shawls fastened in flounces round the waist, which stuck out almost
like a ballet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> girl’s
skirt. The moon flashed on the heavy silver bangles on their arms
and on their silver necklaces and earrings.</p>

<p>The audience were divided into four parties, the object of each
party being to attract the dancers to them by the enthusiasm of
their singing and hand-clapping. A man playing on a flute and
another with a drum led the tune, which was wearily monotonous but
strangely attractive and a fitting accompaniment to the scene.
Gradually the singing became faster and louder, the white-robed
Arabs swayed to and fro urging the dancers to fresh exertions; the
girls revolved more rapidly and one of them began the “Dance de
ventre,” which consists of rather sensuous quivering movements, not
attractive to a European, but much admired by natives. The singing
and hand-clapping became more violent and finally culminated in
frenzied shouting when one of the girls halted, swaying, before the
loudest section of the audience, and several men flung themselves
on their knees, kissing her feet and exclaiming at her beauty,
which if it existed was quite invisible to me, and praising her
skill in dancing with high-flown speeches and compliments. Outside
the circle of brown-faced, white-clad Arabs, and in the doors of
the tents, there were a crowd of women watching the performance,
and a group of dancing girls stood whispering to each other under
their black veils, tinkling their ornaments, as they waited to step
into the circle and relieve their companions.</p>

<p>I stood watching the dancing for a long time, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> then returned to my tent. As I
walked away I heard hoarse shouts of “Ya Ayesha—ya Khadiga,” as two
new girls began to dance, and the whistle and the drum struck up
another queer little melody. Not until almost dawn did quiet reign
again on the desert, broken only by the occasional wail of a
wandering jackal.</p>

<p class="nind space-above15 space-below1"><em>26th.</em>
</p>

<p>Moved off at 4 a.m. and marched till 9.30. We led the camels for
the first two hours along the rocky, difficult ground below the
Scarp, and then up a steep, stony pass to the top. I reached the
top just as the “false dawn” glimmered with a streak of pale light
in the east. There was a heavy dew; all the country down below
looked grey and misty. Gradually the long, twisting line of led
camels reached the summit, and as we rode off across the level
upland towards Siwa the real sunrise began and the stars faded in
the sky. The dew was so thick that the spiders’ webs on the bushes
all sparkled. By midday it was intolerably hot. We halted at a
place called Qur el Beid, a most depressing spot consisting of
three low sand-hills and a tiny patch of vegetation which the
camels sniffed at contemptuously, probably comparing it in their
minds to the much superior grazing near Bir Hamed. I lunched
lightly and lay sweating in my tent with Howa, my Silugi dog, lying
openmouthed and panting at my side till we moved on again for the
afternoon “shid”—march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>The first hour of
the afternoon “shid” is the worst of the day. The swaying motion of
the camel, the glare, and the burning sun beating down, makes one
terribly inclined to sleep, and the hard, yellowish brown desert is
absolutely monotonous. A good “hagin”—riding camel—is very
comfortable to ride when it is trotting, but not at a walk. Its
action is peculiar, first the two off legs move together, and then
the two near legs; this is what causes the swinging motion. There
is an idea that when people first ride a camel they are afflicted
by a sort of sea-sickness, but although I am a bad sailor I have
never felt this, nor have I yet met anyone who did. Camels are very
easy to ride; one just sits on the saddle with legs crossed over
the front pummel, and there is very little chance of falling off as
long as the camel behaves itself. The usual way of mounting is to
make the camel kneel down and then step on to the saddle, but if
one is long-legged and active it is possible to spring up into the
saddle from the ground, which is much quicker and useful when the
ground is hard and unsuitable for the camel to kneel on. A camel’s
usual pace is a slow trot, about 4½-5 miles an hour, and they can
keep up this pace for hours on end. Of course they can go at a sort
of gallop, if they like, and when they do this they cover the
ground at a terrific speed, but it is rather difficult to ride
them, and they have an unpleasant trick of suddenly swerving which
generally shoots one over the camel’s head on to the ground. I have
known, too, camels that bucked, and others that suddenly knelt down
when one did not expect it,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_49">[49]</span> both very disconcerting tricks. They are not
affectionate animals and they never seem to know their own masters;
there was only one among mine that had any “parlour tricks,” and he
used to inhale tobacco smoke through his nose, apparently with the
greatest appreciation.</p>

<p>We saw several gazelle in the afternoon, but all too far away
for a shot. Halted for the night at a place where there were about
four small tufts of vegetation. The camels are less fastidious now
and condescended to nibble at them.</p>

<p>The best time of the day is the evening when the sun sinks low,
the desert becomes a pinkish colour, and our shadows stretch like
huge monsters for yards across the ground. Then I begin to look out
for a camping place, anywhere where there are a few scraps of
dried-up vegetation, or, failing that, a soft-looking patch of
ground where the camels will be comfortable. When we halt the
baggage is unloaded and the camels are allowed to roam about and
eat what they can find; in five minutes my tent is pitched, chair
and table unfolded, and dinner is being prepared. Some of the men
begin measuring out the camels’ dhurra—millet—and others go and
collect bits of stick for the fires, or if there is no wood they
use dry camel dung, which is an excellent fuel. Then the camels are
driven in again, unsaddled and tied down in a long line; at a given
signal the men run along the line and place each one’s food on a
sack in front of its nose. Every man squats down by his own camel
and watches it eat, preventing the ones who<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_50">[50]</span> eat fast from snatching at their
neighbour’s grain. Afterwards the men have their own
supper—lentils, onions, bread and tea, and soon roll themselves up
in their blankets, covering face and all, and go to sleep behind
their saddles, which they use as shelters against the night wind.
The only sound is the munching of the camels and an occasional
hollow gurgle as they chew the cud, and the footsteps of the sentry
as he moves up and down the line, “till the dawn comes in with
golden sandals.”</p>

<p>Abdel Aziz is improving; he produced quite a decent
dinner—sausages, fried onions and potatoes, omelette and coffee,
followed by a cigar. One sleeps splendidly on the desert. Even in
the hottest weather the nights are fairly cool. Towards morning,
just before the “false dawn,” a little cool breeze blows over the
sand and stirs the flaps of one’s tent, like a sort of warning that
soon it will be time to get on the move again.</p>

<p class="nind space-above15 space-below1"><em>27th.</em>
</p>

<p>We marched for six hours in the morning and about four hours in
the afternoon, and camped for the night at the half-way point
between Sollum and Siwa, which is a mound ornamented by a few empty
tins. The temperature in my tent at midday must have been about 120
degrees, and not a scrap of breeze or fresh air. This is real
desert; there is not a vestige of any living thing, animal or
vegetable. The ground is hard limestone covered with dark, shining
pebbles, and in some places there are<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_51">[51]</span> stretches of dried mud, left from the
standing water after the rains. These mud pans are impassable in
wet weather, and one has to make a wide detour to avoid them. Now
they are cracked by the sun into a number of little fissures of a
uniform size, about 6 inches square. The effect is very
curious.</p>

<p>I once motored down to Siwa in a car driven by an English A.S.C.
private who had never been out in the desert before. When we were
running over one of these mud pans he remarked to me, “It seems
wonderful how they have laid bits of this road with paving
blocks—don’t it, sir!” I thought he was trying to be funny, but
when I looked at him I saw that he was perfectly serious, so I
agreed that it was indeed wonderful. Nobody believed the story when
I told it afterwards, but it really did happen.</p>

<p>The mirage is very vivid. Almost all the time one sees what
appears to be a sheet of shining water ahead in the distance, and
one can distinguish bays and islands on it; gradually, as one gets
nearer, it recedes and then fades away. It is like the shimmering
heat that one sometimes sees at home on a hot day, but greatly
intensified. Distances look out of proportion on the desert; little
mounds, too small to be called hills, appear like huge mountains.
About every thirty miles there seem to be slight rises of a
terrace-like formation.</p>

<p>Every evening the men make bread, which they call “khuz.” It is
very simply done and quite good when freshly baked. They take flour
and a little salt and mix it together with water, in a basin or on
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> clean sack,
kneading it into dough with their hands. When it is solid and firm
they smooth it out into a flat, round loaf about 1½ inches thick.
Then they go to the fire, scrape aside all the embers, and lay the
loaf on the hot sand. Then they put the embers back on the top of
the loaf. After a few minutes’ cooking they rake aside the fire
again and turn the loaf, replacing the fire on the top as before.
The time taken in cooking depends on the heat, but is generally
about ten minutes. The bread lasts until the following evening.</p>

<p>All the way we are following what is known as a “mashrab,” a
desert road, which consists of a narrow rut about a foot wide, worn
by the passage of camels through many centuries. Without specially
looking for them one would hardly notice these mashrabs, which are
almost identical to the “gazelle paths” that wind aimlessly about
the desert, but one is helped by the cairns of stones which are
raised by the Arabs on every bit of high ground, sometimes to show
the way and sometimes to mark the lonely grave of a less fortunate
traveller. Each of these twisting desert tracks is known to the
Arabs by a different name. There is the “Mashrab el Khamisa,” from
Bagbag to Siwa, called thus because there are five wells on the
way; there is the “Mashrab el Akhwan”—the Brothers’ Road, from
Jerabub to the coast, which was used by the Senussi Brethren when
they travelled from their Zowia at Jerabub into Egypt; and the
“Mashrab el Abd”—the Slave’s Road, as according to legend, once
upon a time, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> the
dim ages, a slave who was captured and brought by this route into
Egypt from his home in the west, returned to the west and led an
army against Egypt by the very road that he had come by as a
captive. Often the mashrab seems to fade away, and then the
trackers have to ride on ahead and pick it up again. A number of
Bisharin from the North-East Sudan were specially enlisted in the
Camel Corps as trackers and guides. They are thought to be more
skilful at this work than any other tribe, though personally I
think a bedouin is cleverer. But when working in a bedouin country
it is best not to employ local natives. Some of the Bisharin are
almost unnaturally clever, they can follow a footstep over hard,
broken ground where anyone else would see no sign of anything.
These men have a natural instinct for finding the way, a sort of
abnormal bump of locality. When they first arrived on the coast
some of them were wearing the usual clothes of their country and
the fuzzy-wuzzy coiffure that is so remarkable a characteristic of
their race. The Arabs had never seen this type of Sudanese and were
intensely interested in them. Small bedouin boys used to stand and
stare at these tall brown men with the great mops of woolly hair
ornamented with a few skewer-like objects, but the Bisharin were
absolutely indifferent.</p>

<p class="nind space-above15 space-below1"><em>28th.</em>
</p>

<p>Left “Keimat en Nus”—the half-way tent—at a very early hour and
rode for a long time by moonlight;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_54">[54]</span> one can cover more ground when it is cold,
but there is a danger of going off the track. The mashrab is faint
enough in the daytime, but almost invisible at night. When we start
off in the morning all the men shout together three times, “Ya Sidi
Abdel Gader,” invoking a certain sheikh who is the patron sheikh of
travellers. One of my men told me that he was born in Berber “min
zaman”—a long time ago—and used to travel about the Sudan deserts
without water or food. His descendants still live at Berber where
he is buried.</p>

<p>For the first hour or two the men are very lively and rouse the
desert with their singing. Usually one man sings the refrain in a
rather drawling falsetto voice, and then the whole lot take up the
chorus with a real swing, and some of them have very good voices,
too. Sometimes the song is the history of a certain Abu Zeyed, a
legendary character and an exceedingly lewd fellow, from all I
could hear of his doings. Sometimes they would sing stories from
the Thousand and One Nights, or sometimes the songs would be chants
that reminded one of the Gregorian music in a very “High” church at
home. Often I used to ride on ahead, almost out of sight, and then
wait while the chanting voices gradually grew louder, and the long
line of camels came into sight across the white moonlit sands.
There was something very fascinating in the sound of the singing as
we rode through the African desert at night.</p>

<p>But later on, when the sun began to warm up,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> nobody felt like singing.
Occasionally somebody started, and a few voices joined in, but they
very soon subsided again. At the midday halt the men rigged up
rough bivouacs with blankets, and rifles as tent poles, then for
several hours one lay in the scanty shade, feeling like a pat of
butter that had been left out in the sun by mistake.</p>

<p>Howa is getting very tired. I picked her up and carried her on
the saddle across my knees for several hours to-day. She is quite
fit, but 200 miles in the hot weather does take it out of a dog.
The camels are in good condition but much looking forward to water,
their flanks are beginning to look “tucked in,” and at night some
of them groan and gurgle horribly. To-morrow we should be in the
oasis at the first well. This evening I functioned with the
medicine chest; I gave several of the men pills and Eno’s, which
they enjoyed, and dressed a foot with a bad cut on it. My own knees
are like raw beef from the sun, though I’ve been wearing shorts all
the summer. We have to be “canny” with the water as several of the
“fanatis”—water-cans—are leaking. Fortunately I have trained myself
only to drink a little in the morning and evening, and I can wash
quite thoroughly in two cups of water.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the evening I walk right away from the camp into
the utter quiet of the desert, out of sight of camels and men. It
is a wonderful sensation to be in such absolute silence, with
nothing to see but the horizon and “the rolling heaven itself.”
Then I retrace my footsteps to the camp<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_56">[56]</span> and enjoy the pleasant feeling of seeing the
twinkling fires in the distance, and arriving at a neatly laid
dinner-table right in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p class="nind space-above15 space-below1"><em>29th.</em>
</p>

<p>In the early morning, before dawn, we passed a caravan going
north. I rode over to see who they were and found that it was a
party of Mogabara Arabs on their way up to the coast, and thence
into Egypt. One of them, Ibrahaim el Bishari, is quite a well-known
merchant who travels about Egypt, Tripoli and the Sudan. He had
come lately up from Darfur, via Kufra, Jalow and Jerabub, and was
going down to the Sudan again after spending some time in Egypt. He
talked about people I knew in Darfur and carried “chits” from a
number of Englishmen. His fellows looked a fine lot of men, very
different to the few Siwans who were travelling with them. I should
have liked to have seen the stuff in his loads; he said he had some
good carpets that he hoped to sell in Egypt. We wished each other a
prosperous journey, and so parted “like ships that pass in the
night.”</p>

<p>We camped at midday within sight of the high country above the
oasis. This morning one of my<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_57">[57]</span> men was talking about the Sudan and touched
on the “Bilad el Kelab”—the Country of Dogs. All Sudanese believe
that this place exists somewhere down in the south of the Sudan
towards Uganda. I have seen them draw maps on the sand to show its
position. In this mysterious country all the men become dogs at
sunset time and roam about the gloomy forests like the werewolves
of mediæval fiction. I have heard the men yarning over the camp
fires and saying how their cousin’s wife’s brother—or some such
distant relation—actually reached this country and returned alive.
Of course it is always somebody else who saw it, but the story is
firmly believed by all Sudanese, and so it is a very favourite
topic of conversation. Sometimes they enlarge on it and tell how
So-and-So married a wife from that country and one night a number
of dogs arrived at his hut and carried the woman away with
them.</p>

<p>This afternoon we ascended from the desert to the high limestone
range that forms a rampart to the oasis on the north, and then we
started crawling down into the Siwa valley. The desert plateau is
about 600 feet above sea-level, and the oasis is 72 feet below it,
and as the height of the hills is considerable there is a big drop
down into the oasis. The track winds in and out through strange
rocky passes, among weirdly shaped cliffs whose tortured shapes
remind one of Gustave Doré’s illustration of the Inferno. These
wild ravines are utterly desolate, even in the spring no vegetation
grows among them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
This is a land of broken stone where huge boulders seem to have
been hurled about by giant hands. The sun sank low before we had
escaped from the mountains, and the fantastically shaped crags were
silhouetted with monstrous shadows against the yellow sky.
Sometimes the narrow road seemed to cling to the side of a towering
cliff, and at other times it twined in and out through deep,
echoing valleys in the shadow of the overhanging, jagged rocks. In
places the camels had to be led in single file. Once the men began
to sing, but the dismal echoes among the caves sounded almost
inhumanly depressing, so they gave it up, and we marched along in
silence. Finally a line of far distant green appeared down below
between two great cliffs, and one could see, very faintly, the
masses of graceful palms nodding their crests over the murmuring
oasis. To weary men after a six days’ camel ride across the desert
the first glimpse of Siwa is like the sight of the sea to those
ancient Greeks on the far-away shores of the Euxine.</p>

<p>When all the camels had come out from the last valley among the
rocks we “got mounted” and rode for about half a mile, past groups
of palm trees, already heavy with clusters of yellow dates, to Ein
Magahiz, which is the first spring in the oasis. Here we camped for
the night, watered the camels, who simply revelled in the water,
and I enjoyed a luxurious bathe in the deep cool spring which rises
among a cluster of palm trees. All night we could<span class=

Siwa town, which is only a mile or so away.</p>

</p>

<p>The mosquitoes last night were a reminder that we are no longer
up on the high desert; they were maddening, in spite of a net. This
morning everybody bathed and shaved and generally polished up. We
rode across to the town in great style; past the palm-shaded
gardens with fences of yellow “gerida”—palm branches; past the
white rest house, on the terraced side of a curious conical hill
called “The Hill of the Dead,” honeycombed with rock tombs; past
the long low “Markaz,” where the mamur and the police guard turned
out to see us; across the wide market square, and through the
narrow streets between tall houses of sunbaked clay below the
enormous high walls of the old town. The heat was already great,
and the streets were almost deserted, except for a few recumbent
figures in a shady corner of the market-place, who scrambled up as
we rode by and then hurried off to tell their friends that the
“Hagana”—Camel Corps—had arrived.</p>

<p>The Camel Corps barracks and the District Officer’s house are
out on the sand about half a mile south of the town. They occupy
two isolated rocks about a quarter of a mile apart, which were
formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> the
strongholds of two Siwan sheikhs. The District Officer’s house
stands on a limestone rock about 50 feet high. It is a high house
built of mud and palm log beams. To reach it one goes up a steep
path in the rock with roughly cut steps on to a little terrace with
a sort of loggia that opens through the building into the large
courtyard behind, which is surrounded by a high loopholed wall.
There are two rooms on the ground floor, both high and long, about
30 by 15 feet, and two more rooms above with a roofed loggia and an
open roof. The rooms have three windows in each, with glass in
them, the only glass in Siwa, facing north and looking across the
grove of palm trees below the house to the strange-looking town on
its two rocks. The house was built by the former District Officer,
who added to the old Siwan fortress which existed there; it has a
wonderful position and is high enough to be free from
mosquitoes.</p>

<p>I spent a busy day settling down and fixing up things with S——,
who starts with his section for the coast in two days. S——is
heartily sick of Siwa and longing to see the last of it. We dined
on the terrace outside—to the accompaniment of throbbing tom-toms
over in the town—on soup, chicken, caramel pudding and a dish of
every sort of fruit, which was a pleasant change after months on
the coast without any. Caramel pudding is the “pièce de résistance”
of every cook in Egypt; unless one orders the meal it always
appears on the menu. S——’s cook is an indifferent one. Out
here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> I have noticed a
universal habit of considering, or pretending to consider, one’s
own servants absolute paragons of virtue, honesty, cleanliness and
skill, and invariably running down everybody else’s. I have heard
men hold forth for hours on the excellent qualities of their
Mohammed, or Abdel, knowing myself that Mohammed—or Abdel—or
whatever his name may be, was a double-dyed villain and swindling
his master right and left—but now I am doing it myself!</p>

<p class="space-above15">I think what impressed me most on arriving
at Siwa was the intense heat, the excellent bathing, the enormous
height and strange appearance of the town, and the incessant sound
of tom-toms from sunset onwards. One misses “the slow shrill creak
of the water wheels, a mournful cry, half groan, half wail,” which
is such a feature of Egypt and the Sudan. The average temperature
in the summer was about 108 degrees in the shade, or on warmer days
110 degrees or 112 degrees, but the nights were cool, and every
evening regularly at about eight o’clock a little breeze blew
across from the east and freshened things up. The only way to keep
the house cool was by leaving the doors and windows open all night,
and keeping them closed and tightly shuttered during the day. It
resulted in dark rooms, but at least they were fairly cool and free
from flies. I soon made the house very comfortable with some rough
home-made furniture and a few carpets and mats.</p>

<p>When a new Section of Camel Corps arrived at<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> Siwa one of the first events
that occurred was the “taking over” of wives. In most cases the men
who were leaving handed on their wives to the new men, in the same
way as the stores, barracks, camels, etc., were officially handed
over by the officer who was going away to his relief. On the day
before the new Section rode in all the ladies retired from the camp
<em>en masse</em> to the houses of their relations in the town; the
new men then entered into negotiations with the retiring Section
for the taking over of the wives. A few of the men sought fresh
pastures, but most of them took on the wife of a man they knew well
in the other Section. On the day that the departing Section left
Siwa all the ladies assembled on the road that they would pass,
carrying their boxes and belongings, and when the camels came by
they shrieked and wept, throwing dust on their heads, beating their
breasts, pretending to tear their clothes, and showing signs of the
most frantic sorrow at the departure of the men. As soon as the
camels were round the corner out of sight they brushed off the
dust, put on their bracelets, tidied themselves up and hurried
merrily across to the “harimat” outside the barracks, followed by
boys carrying their boxes, to their new husbands who were waiting
for them. This performance happened regularly whenever there was an
exchange of Sections. I used to watch the little tragi-comedy from
my terrace. The harimat of Siwa consisted of a number of rush huts
below the rock on which the fort was built. If any of the wives
caused trouble, and they often did, they were<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_63">[63]</span> ejected and never allowed to marry a
soldier again. Polygamy was forbidden, and each lady, before she
married, was required to produce a certificate stating that she was
a respectable person, signed by several sheikhs and notables of the
town. The Siwans had no objection to these alliances between
Sudanese soldiers and Siwan women, as women in Siwa outnumber the
men at the rate of three to one.</p>

<p>The daily routine at Siwa did not vary very much. In the summer
I was generally called at 5.30, in time to run down from the house
and have one plunge in the cool deep bathing pool in the palm grove
below the rock before dressing. Clothes were a very minor matter;
one wore simply shirt, shorts, shoes and stockings, all of the
thinnest material. Then I used to walk over to the C.C. barracks
and take the parade, sometimes mounted drill, sometimes dismounted.
We did mounted drill on a stretch of firm white sand among the
dunes south of the barracks. Breakfast was at about eight—eggs,
coffee, bread and jam, the eggs being even smaller than Egyptian
ones, about the size of bantam’s eggs, so one needed a lot for a
meal. After breakfast I went across to the barracks again, and then
rode down through the town on my pony to the Markaz.</p>

<p>The path to the town passed over a disused cemetery where the
pony was very liable to stick its foot through the thin layer of
soil above the graves, under an archway and into the street that
divides the Eastern and Western quarters. The street itself was
hard rock and very steep in parts, but owing to the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> height of the tall houses on
each side it was generally cool and shady and a favourite
resting-place of the inhabitants, many of whom lay stretched full
length across the street taking their siesta. But the clattering
hoofs of my pony generally roused them, and they scrambled out of
the way when I came. The Siwans are well mannered, a virtue that
one never sees in Egypt nowadays, and even in the Sudan it is on
the wane. When I rode or walked in the town everybody would stand
up as I passed, and if I met people riding they would dismount
until I had gone on. I have heard people at home say what a scandal
it is that in some places the poor downtrodden natives have to
stand up and move off the path for an Englishman, but after all
they would do exactly the same for their own Pashas, and apart from
being an Englishman one was entitled to respect as being the
representative of the Egyptian Government in Siwa. Once I was badly
“had” over this. I was riding through the market with some
policemen following me on my way to make an inspection. There was a
group of Siwans sitting talking on the ground, and as I passed they
all stood up—except one man who remained comfortably seated in the
shade right in the middle of the path. I ordered one of the
policemen to see who he was and to bring him along to the Markaz to
answer for his bad manners. A few minutes later the man from the
market was led into the office. He was stone blind!</p>

<p>The Markaz is a large building outside the town with square
courtyard surrounded by prisons, stores<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_65">[65]</span> and offices. It has a permanent guard of
locally enlisted police; they are quite smart men, but of little
use when there is trouble in the town, and always at enmity with
the Sudanese Camel Corps. At the Markaz I would usually find a
number of petitions to be read and examined, some cases to be
tried, and probably people applying for permits to cross the
frontier who would have to be questioned and seen. Then the sheikhs
would arrive and there would be discussions about various
things—taxes, labour, work on the drains or Government buildings,
new regulations and orders, and then perhaps the merchants would be
summoned, and a heated controversy would follow about the price of
sugar, or the butchers would come to complain of the cost of meat.
It was like a daily meeting of a town council, and complicated by
innumerable interests, rivalries and intrigues. All these matters,
though they sound very small, were of considerable importance to
the Siwans.</p>

<p>There were six sheikhs recognized by the Administration, three
of them eastern, and three western. Sheikh Saleh Said was the most
influential and the most unbiassed by personal considerations. He
was a big handsome man with a dark moustache and features that
might have been copied from the bust of a Roman consul. He always
wore a long blue robe, and was the most dignified and impressive of
the sheikhs. I never saw him in a hurry or at all excited. Sheikh
Thomi was a little dark fellow, and reputed to be the richest man
in Siwa. He had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
queer, quick way of speaking, was intensely obstinate, a staunch
Westerner, but honest—as far as I ever knew. I once offended him
very grievously. One day he sent me a basket of grapes, the first
that had ripened in his vineyards. I gave the servant boy a piastre
for bringing them. The boy returned and presented the piastre to
Sheikh Thomi, who was very hurt at being sent 2½d. when he had made
me a gift of fruit. Sheikh Thomi was a man of means and worth
several thousand pounds. I heard about the piastre incident and
explained it to him. To offer to pay for what is meant as a present
is a real breach of good manners, much worse than refusing it.</p>

<p>Sheikh Mohammed Abdel Rahman was a venerable white-bearded
individual who had been to Mecca and apparently lived on his
reputation of excessive sanctity; he always agreed with everything
I said, and then if I veered round and deliberately contradicted
myself he did the same—it was not helpful!</p>

<p>Abdulla Hemeid was a sly, fat, greedy man with a pale face and
blue eyes. He was very stingy and always complaining against
taxation or anything that affected his pocket. He never gave an
entertainment, but I always noticed him eating heartily in other
people’s houses. His family were much esteemed and he had succeeded
his father, who had been a very famous man in Siwa.</p>

<p>Mohammed Ragah was a thin, dark, hawk-like man, more like an
Arab than a Siwan. He was very badly off for a sheikh, but keen and
clever, and not above doing a bit of hard work with his own hands.
He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> was the only man
in Siwa at whose house one was given good coffee. He had shown
great courage during the Senussi occupation in protecting some
Egyptian officials who were in Siwa.</p>

<p>Mahdi Abdel Nebi, Sheikh of Aghourmi, was the youngest of the
sheikhs, and the most reasonable and intelligent, though he had
never been out of Siwa. He was a cheerful, pleasant fellow, but
cordially disliked by the rest of the sheikhs. These six were the
men who to a certain extent controlled the destinies of Siwa.</p>

<p>About once every week when I arrived at the Markaz I would find
the doctor, or the mamur, or the clerk waiting for me in a state of
tearful hysterics, begging me to forward his resignation to the
Governor, as he could exist no longer in the company of his
colleagues—the two other officials. Then would follow a long
infantile complaint. If I could not smooth him down I had to bring
in the other two, who would also dissolve into tears, and try and
get to the bottom of the affair, which was always absolutely
childish and ridiculous. On one occasion the mamur had refused to
allow the doctor to have a watchman to escort him home past a
certain graveyard which alarmed him, or the clerk accused the mamur
of inveigling his cook into his service, or something equally
small. Unfortunately the clerk was a Copt, the doctor a Syrian, and
the mamur was a Cairene. It went on unceasingly, the most
preposterous things served to bring one of them weeping to my
office. And when they were relieved their<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_68">[68]</span> successors were just the same. Yet they were
good men at their work; the clerk had a heavy amount of office work
and did it well; the doctor was quite clever and had been trained
in America; and the mamur was good at his job. Exactly the same
thing occurred among the native officials on the coast, so it was
not only the effect of Siwan solitude.</p>

<p>From the Markaz I rode home, and after a light lunch either
painted, read, or went to sleep till about four, when I had another
bathe, followed by tea. After tea I went over to the Camel Corps
for “stables,” and then generally out for a walk. Sometimes I went
to Gebel Muta, the Hill of the Dead, a rocky hill on the north of
the town full of tombs hewn out of the living rock, some of them
being large and lofty with as many as eight coffin spaces round the
sides. In one of them there were the remains of a coloured wall
painting with figures of men and animals. Other times I climbed up
to the top of the town. The view from the flat roofs of the highest
houses on the rock is very wonderful, especially at sunset. On the
south of the town there is a long ridge of rolling yellow
sand-hills which change their contours when the desert winds sweep
across them, and become pink and salmon-coloured in the evenings;
towards the north one looks across a sea of palm groves and
brilliant green cultivation to the jagged range of mountains that
separate Siwa from the desert; on the west there is a great square
mountain with a gleaming silver salt lake at its foot, and in the
east one sees the little village of Aghourmi<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_69">[69]</span> crowning another high rock which rises
above the tree-tops.</p>

<p>At sunset the scene is exquisite, the hills turn from pink to
mauve, and from mauve to purple, and their peaks are sharply
outlined against the gold and crimson sky; long violet shadows
spread across the rosy-tinted sand-hills, and the palm groves seem
to take on a more vivid shade of green. The smoke ascends in thin
spirals from the evening fires, and a low murmur rises from the
streets and squares below; then suddenly the prayer of the muezzin
sounds from the many mosques, and one can see the white-robed
figures swaying to and fro on the narrow pinnacles of the round
towers that in Siwa take the place of minarets. When the call to
prayer is over and the last mournful chant has echoed across the
oasis, and the glow in the sky is fading away, one hears far down
beneath the soft thudding of a tom-tom and perhaps the faint whine
of a reed pipe. When the deep blue Libyan night covers the city the
music becomes louder and seems to throb like a feverish pulse from
the heart of the town.</p>

<p>Often in the evening I rode out and called on the Sheikh of
Aghourmi, which is the little village on another rock two miles
from Siwa. Mahdi Abdel Nebi had recently succeeded to his father as
Sheikh of Aghourmi and was having some difficulty in sustaining his
authority, even with the support of the Administration, against the
plots and intrigues of an old cousin of his, one Haj Mohammed
Hammam, a sly old man who was rich, influential, and a
thorough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> scoundrel,
and wished to oust his cousin and become sheikh himself. After the
war Haj Hammam had carefully cultivated the acquaintance of any
British officers who came to Siwa, and he was inordinately proud of
knowing their names and of certain small gifts that they had given
him—a broken compass, a highly coloured biscuit tin and some
photographs. These he showed on every occasion, and also remarked
that they used always to call him “<em>The</em> Sheikh of
Aghourmi”—this apparently being his only claim to the title.</p>

<p>Hammam used to employ people to let him know immediately when I
was riding out to Aghourmi, so that he, and not the sheikh, should
be waiting to receive me at the gates; then he would try to
persuade me to accept his hospitality instead of the sheikh’s.
Sheikh Mahdi always invited his old cousin to the tea drinking,
though I could well have dispensed with him, but one could not
object to the presence of another guest. Sheikh Mahdi’s house was
the only one in which a woman ever appeared when I was there. She
was an old Sudanese slave woman who had been brought many years ago
from the Sudan. Once I got her to tell me her story, but she spoke
such a queer mixture of Arabic and Siwan that it was difficult to
follow.</p>

<p>It appeared that when she was about eight years old she and her
small brother were playing outside their village somewhere in the
North-West Sudan, and a band of Arabs—slave raiders—swooped down
and carried them off. They were taken up into<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_71">[71]</span> Tripoli and there she was sold to another
Arab who brought her to Siwa on his way to Egypt. She fell ill and
almost died, so the Arab, who did not want to delay, sold her cheap
to the Sheikh of Aghourmi, father of the present one; he handed her
over to his wife who cured the child. She remained at Aghourmi for
the rest of her life. She was a lively old body and told the story
in a very cheerful way, giggling and laughing, not apparently
feeling any wish to return to her own land.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw5">

<p class="cp1">SHEIKH MAHDI ABDEL NEBI, OF AGHOURMI WITH HIS

</div>

<p>Aghourmi is almost more picturesque than Siwa. The road to the
gate passes below the overhanging rock on which the houses stand,
which is thickly surrounded by a luxuriant wilderness of apricot,
fig and palm trees. The steep path to the village goes under three
archways, each with an enormous wooden gateway, and this path is
the only possible means of entering the place. Above one of the
gates there is a high tower, and the houses alongside the path are
loopholed so that an enemy making an attack could be safely fired
at from all sides by the defenders. Inside the town there is the
same dark maze of narrow streets as in Siwa, with wells and olive
presses, but all on a smaller scale than those in Siwa town. There
are a few houses below the walls. The sheikh lives in the middle of
the town in a big, high house with a roof that has as fine a view
as any that I have seen.</p>

<p>I got home after sunset and often had another bathe—by
moonlight—before changing into flannels for dinner, which I had on
the terrace in front of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_72">[72]</span> house. I slept upstairs, on the roof, but I
always kept a spare bed ready in the room as quite often a wild
“haboob”—sand-storm—would blow up in the middle of the night, and
even indoors one would be smothered and choked with sand. Such was
the average day at Siwa, and by nine or ten o’clock one was glad to
turn in.</p>

<p>Occasionally after dinner one of the natives who were employed
as secret service agents would arrive very mysteriously at the
house on some excuse and report that there were fire-arms in the
house of So-and-So. Sometimes the information was no more than an
exaggerated rumour, but if it sounded true I would make a night
raid on the person who was supposed to have rifles. These night
raids were very dramatic, but did not always yield the harvest that
was expected. The informer would lead the way, disguised by a
turban pulled low over his head and a scarf muffling his eyes. I
followed with a dozen armed Sudanese. The difficulty was to prevent
the owner of the house getting wind of us before we surrounded the
building, and to surround a Siwan house which has dozens of doors
and passages and exits over roofs is no easy matter. It was not a
matter of entering a hostile town, but of surprising a household.
We would pad silently into the town, and anybody who we met roaming
the streets would be attached to the party to prevent his giving
warning. On reaching the house the guide slipped away in the
darkness, and I surrounded the house with men; then at a whistle
each man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> lit a torch
and I beat on the door and demanded admittance.</p>

<p>Immediately the wildest hullabaloo began inside—men shouting,
women yelling, donkeys braying and hens cackling. Sometimes this
was done in order to distract our attention from somebody who tried
to slip out and remove the rifles to a safe hiding-place. When the
door was opened all the male occupants were marched outside and the
harem sent into one room, where they sat on the floor with shawls
over their heads and reviled us—but in Siwan, so nobody was any the
wiser. The house was searched from top to bottom, the ceilings
probed, the mats raised, and every room examined. Sometimes the
rifles were buried in the floor, or hidden in bales of hay.
Occasionally a modern rifle and some ammunition was found, but
usually some old Arab guns and a bag or two of shot and gunpowder.
If we had a successful haul the master of the house would be
marched off in custody to the jail in the Markaz, and next day he
would be tried, and probably heavily fined or imprisoned.</p>

<p class="dcap">SIWA lies thickly covered with “the Dust of
History,” and its story is difficult to trace. For certain periods
one is able to collect information on the subject, but during many
centuries nothing is known. Some of the leading sheikhs have in
their possession ancient documents and treaties which have been
handed down through many generations from father to son. There is
also an old Arabic history of Siwa, which appears to have been
written some time during the fifteenth century, kept by the family
whose members have always held a position corresponding to that of
a town clerk, but this old history is so interwoven with curious
legends and fables that it is difficult to separate fact from
fiction. I used to sit in the garden of the old sheikh who owned
the book and listen while he read. He was a venerable but rascally
old fellow in flowing white robes, the green turban of a “Haj,” and
huge horn spectacles. The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_75">[75]</span> book itself was a muddled collection of loose
sheets of manuscript kept in a leather bag.</p>

<p>Roughly the history of Siwa can be divided into four periods.
The first, which is also the greatest period, dates from the
foundation of the Temple of Jupiter Ammon. The second period begins
at the Mohammedan invasion in the seventh century <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> The third period commences with the subjugation
of Siwa by Mohammed Ali, early in the nineteenth century; and the
fourth and last period is the history of Siwa during the Great
War.</p>

<h3><a id="c03s1"></a>(1)</h3>

<p class="sch3">FIRST PERIOD</p>

<p class="sch2">The Temple of Jupiter Ammon</p>

<p>According to the late Professor Maspero, the great authority on
Egyptian antiquities, the oasis of Siwa was not connected with
Egypt until about the sixteenth century <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> In about 1175 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> the
Egyptian oases, of which Siwa is one, were colonized by Rameses
III, but very little authentic information is available on the
history of Siwa until it came definitely under the influence of
Egypt in the sixth century <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> Mr. Oric
Bates, in his exhaustive work, <em>The Eastern Libyans</em>, states
that the original deity of the oasis was a sun god, a protector of
flocks, probably with the form of a bull. The African poet
Coreippus, mentions a ram-headed Libyan divinity<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> called Gurzil who was
represented as being the offspring of the original prophetic God of
Siwa. His priests fought in battles, and the emblem of the god was
carried by the Libyans in the fray. A sacred stone at Siwa is
referred to by Pliny, which when touched by an irreverent hand
stirred at once a strong and harmful sand-wind. The theory of sun
worship, and the idea of an evil wind directed by some spirit in a
stone is substantiated by the local customs and legends which are
prevalent in Siwa at the present time.</p>

<p>It is certain that when the Egyptians occupied Siwa, in about
550 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>, according to Mr. Bates, they
discovered a local Libyan god firmly established and supported by a
powerful but barbarous cult. So great was its reputation that King
Crœsus of Lydia travelled to Siwa and consulted the oracle a little
before, or at the time of, the Egyptian occupation. The Egyptians
identified the local god of the oasis with their own Ammon. In the
fourth century <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> the god Ammon, of the
Ammonians, for this was the name by which the people of Siwa were
now known, had become one of the most famous oracles of the ancient
world. At the time when the Egyptians recognized and worshipped the
god of the oasis, a number of stories became prevalent, tending to
prove that the deity at Siwa originated from the Ammon of Thebes,
and one legend even went so far as to assert that the Ammon of
Thebes was himself originally a Libyan herdsman who was deified by
Dionysius. The following are some of the many legends
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> relate the
origin of the Siwan god, and which suggest its connection with the
Theban Ammon.</p>

<p>Herodotus, in whose works there are frequent allusions to the
Ammonians, describes the inhabitants of the oasis of Ammon as being
colonists from Egypt and Ethiopia, speaking a mixed language, and
calling themselves Ammonians, owing to the Egyptians worshipping
Jupiter under the name of Ammon. He relates that the colonists
instituted an oracle in imitation of the famous one on the Isle of
Meroë, and mentions the following account of its origin. Two black
girls who served in the Temple of Jupiter Ammon at Thebes were
carried away by Phœnician merchants. One of them was taken to
Greece, where she afterwards founded the Temple of Dodona, which
became a well-known oracle; the other was sold into Libya and
eventually arrived at the kingdom of the Ammonians. Owing to her
strange language, which resembled “the twittering of a bird,” she
was supposed by the inhabitants to possess supernatural qualities;
her reputation increased, and her utterances came to be regarded as
the words of an oracle. There is a different version of the same
fable in which the girls are represented as two black doves, one
flying to Greece, the other to Libya.</p>

<p>According to Diodorus Siculus the Temple of Jupiter Ammon was
built as far back as 1385 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>, by Danaus
the Egyptian. Rollins, in his <em>History of the Ancient
World</em>, names Ham, the son of Noah, as the deity in whose
honour the temple was built by<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_78">[78]</span> the Ammonians. Another legend tells that
Dionysius was lost in the desert on one of his fantastic
expeditions and nearly died from thirst when suddenly a ram
appeared, which led the party to a bubbling spring. They built a
temple on the spot, in gratitude, and ornamented it with
representations of a ram’s head. It is interesting to compare this
story with one of the legends written in the Arabic history of
Siwa. A Siwan, journeying in the desert, was led by a ram to a
mysterious city where he found an avenue of black stone lions. He
returned home, and set out again at a later date, meaning to
rediscover the place, but he never found it again. In both cases it
is a ram that led the way, and the god of Siwa is represented as
having a ram’s head.</p>

<p>The temple, whose ruins are to be seen at the village of
Aghourmi, near Siwa, was built probably during the sixth century
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> The date is decided by the style of
its architecture. This temple was known to the Egyptians as “Sakhit
Amouou,” the “Field of Palms,” owing to its situation among groves
of palm trees. It is evident that at this time Siwa was the
principal island in a desert archipelago consisting of several
oases, most of which are now uninhabited, obeying a common king and
owing their prosperity to the great temple of the oracle. Such a
cluster of islands would invest the dynasty to which King Clearchus
and King Lybis belonged with considerable importance. Herodotus
tells how certain Cyrenians held a conversation with Clearchus,
King of the Ammonians, who told them that a party<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> of young men had set off on an
expedition from his country to the west, through a wild region full
of savage animals, eventually arriving at a great river where they
found a race of small black men. They supposed this river to be a
branch or tributary of the Nile, but it was actually the river
Niger. Thus it is shown that at this period Siwa was an independent
monarchy. The Ammonians lived under the rule of their own kings and
priests, and chieftainship was associated with priesthood. Silius
Italicus describes the warrior priest Nabis, an Ammonian chief,
“fearless and splendidly armed,” riding in the army of
Hannibal.</p>

<p>Another early visitor to the oasis was Lysander the Spartan.
Being disappointed by the oracle of Dodona he travelled to Siwa,
under colour of making a vow at the temple, but hoping to bribe the
priests to his interests. Notwithstanding “the fullness of his
purse” and the great friendship between his father and Lybis, King
of the Ammonians, he was totally unsuccessful, and the priests sent
ambassadors to Sparta accusing Lysander of attempting to bribe the
holy oracle. But “he so subtly managed his defence that he got off
clear.” The Greeks held the oracle of Ammon in great veneration.
The Athenians kept a special galley in which they conveyed
questions across the sea to Libya. Mersa Matruh, sometimes called
Ammonia, was the port for Siwa, and it was here that the
ambassadors and visitors disembarked and started on their desert
journey to the oasis. The poet Pindar dedicated an ode to Jupiter
Ammon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> which was
preserved under the altar of the temple for some six hundred years;
and the sculptor Calamis set up a statue to the god of the
Ammonians in the Temple of Thebes at Karnak.</p>

<p>In 525 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>, Cambyses, wishing to
consolidate his newly acquired dominions in Northern Africa,
dispatched two expeditions, one against Carthage, the other into
Ethiopia. He made Memphis his base of operations and sent 50,000
men as an advance party to occupy the oasis of Ammon. His generals
had orders to rob and burn the temple, make captives of the people
and to prepare halting-places for the bulk of the army. They passed
the oasis of Khargeh and proceeded north-west. But the whole army
was lost in the sea of desert that lies between Siwa and Khargeh.
The Ammonians, on inquiries being made, reported that the army was
overwhelmed by a violent sand-storm during a midday halt. But it is
more probable that they lost their way during one of the periodical
sand-storms which are so prevalent in this desert region, and were
overcome by thirst in the waterless, trackless desert. There was no
further news; they never reached the temple, and not one of the
soldiers returned to Egypt. This huge army still lies buried
somewhere in that torrid waste, and perhaps some fortunate
traveller may at a future date stumble unawares on the remains of
the once mighty host. In the old Arabic history there are two other
stories of armies that were lost in the desert. In one case it was
a Siwan army which opposed the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_81">[81]</span> Mohammedan invaders, and in the other case an
army of raiders from Tebu were lost on their way to attack the
oasis.</p>

<p>In 500 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>, Siwa and the other oases
were subjected to Persia, and in the following year Cimon, the
celebrated Athenian general, sent a secret embassy to the oracle
while he was besieging Citium in Cyprus. The deputation was greeted
by the oracle with the words, “Cimon is already with me,” and on
their return it was found that Cimon had himself perished in
battle. The foretelling of Cimon’s death augmented considerably the
reputation of the oracle.</p>

<p>Oracles were most frequently situated in the vicinity of some
natural phenomena; this at Siwa consisted of a sacred spring known
as “Fons Solis,” the “Fountain of the Sun,” which by its
strangeness contributed to the divine qualities of the temple. Very
probably it was the “Ein el Hammam” which lies about a quarter of a
mile south of the temple ruins and is to-day one of the largest and
most beautiful springs in the oasis. Ancient writers describe its
waters as being warm in the morning, cold at noon and boiling hot
at midnight. Blind, black fish lived in the pool, according to the
Arabic history, which was connected with the rites of the temple.
The water to-day is a trifle warmer than most of the springs, and
for that reason it is the favourite bathing-place of the
inhabitants of Aghourmi. I have stood by the spring at midnight and
tested its warmth, but it seemed in no way to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_82">[82]</span> differ from the other springs, except that
it was a very little warmer.</p>

<p>There are many contemporary descriptions of the actual temple,
and antiquarians have from time to time disputed as to its original
size and form. It appears to have consisted of a main building, or
sanctuary, surrounded by triple walls which enclosed the
dwelling-places of the king, priests and the guards, standing on a
rocky eminence among the palm groves. A smaller temple stood a few
hundred yards south of the acropolis. The rock on which the village
of Aghourmi now stands was evidently the site of the original
temple and fortress, and the ruins below the village, known as “Omm
Beyda,” are those of the minor temple. The two temples were
connected by an underground passage.</p>

<p>The old history of Siwa gives a detailed description of the
court of the king. The following is a rough translation. “At one
period Siwa ranked among the important towns of the Egyptian
sovereigns. It was ruled by a king called Meneclush who built a
town and cultivated the land. He made the men drill and inaugurated
a seven days’ feast in commemoration of his succession. The people
of King Meneclush dressed richly and wore golden ornaments. The
king lived in a stone and granite palace, and assembled his people
in a great square which had four different courts, and in each
court there was a statue which caught the sun at different times of
the day, and when the sun shone upon the statues they spoke. When
the people assembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
they stood on seven steps. On the highest step sat the king, below,
in succession, the king’s family, priests, astrologers and
magicians, generals and courtiers, architects, soldiers, and,
below, the people. Each step was inscribed with these words, ‘Look
down, not towards the step above, lest ye become proud’—thus
inculcating the principle of modesty. The king lived in a palace
called Kreibein, inside the walls. In those days there were many
buildings in Siwa, spreading from Omm Beyda to Gebel Dakrour. King
Meneclush was stabbed by a girl and is buried, with his horse, in
the Khazeena, underneath Aghourmi. . . . At a later period Siwa was
divided into two parts ruled by two princes called Ferik and Ibrik.
Afterwards a queen called Khamissa ruled in Siwa and gave her name
to the square hill at the end of the Western lake.”</p>

<p>Much of the history is missing, and at times it plunges into
descriptions of neighbouring countries, but it is interesting to
find mention of “statues that speak” when touched by the sun.</p>

<p>As recently as 1837 there was a considerable portion of the
smaller temple standing. Travellers described the roof, made of
massive blocks of stone, the coloured ceilings, and the walls
covered with hieroglyphics and sculptured figures. But the
depredations of Arab treasure hunters, and a Turkish Governor who
committed an unpardonable vandalism by blowing up the temple with
gunpowder in order to obtain stone for building an office, have
reduced the once imposing building to a single<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_84">[84]</span> ruined pylon, or gateway, which towers
above the surrounding gardens, a pathetic reminder of its former
grandeur. This solitary ruin, and two massive stone gateways almost
hidden by mud buildings in the middle of the village of Aghourmi,
is all that remains of the temple that was once famous throughout
the world. In a way the ruins are symbolic of Siwa which was once a
powerful dominion, but is now nothing more than a wretched desert
station with three or four thousand degenerate inhabitants.</p>

<p>In 331 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> the fame of the oracle
reached its zenith, owing to Alexander the Great visiting it after
having settled his affairs in Egypt. The visit to the famous oracle
was undertaken in order to inquire into the mysterious origin of
his birth. Probably at the same time Alexander wished to emulate
the deeds of Hercules, from whom he claimed descent, and who was
supposed during his wanderings to have visited the oasis. He
marched along the coast to Parætonium—Matruh—where he was met by
ambassadors from Cyrene, a wealthy city on the coast some 400 miles
further west, who presented him gifts of chariots and war horses.
He then turned south across the desert into a region “where there
was nothing but heaps of sand.” After journeying four days the
water supply, carried in skins, gave out, and the army was in
danger of perishing from thirst when, by a fortunate chance, or by
the direct interposition of the gods, the sky became black with
clouds, rain fell, and by this miraculous means the army was
preserved from destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>A little later the
expedition lost its way, and after wandering for miles was saved by
the appearance of a number of ravens who, flying before the army,
guided them eventually to the temple. They found the oasis “full of
pleasant fountains, watered with running streams, richly planted
with all sorts of trees bearing fruit, surrounded by a vast dry and
sandy desert, waste and untilled . . . the temperature of the air
was like spring, yet all the place around it was dry and scorching
. . . a most healthful climate.” Alexander was received by the
oracle with divine honours, and returned to Egypt satisfied that he
was indeed the authentic son of Zeus. As the son of the god he
became a legitimate Pharoah, and adopted the pschent crown and its
accompanying rites.</p>

<p>About this time various nations applied to the oracle for
permission to deify their rulers, and on the death of his friend
Hephistion, Alexander dispatched another embassy asking that
Hephistion might be ranked as a hero. When Alexander died, in 323
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span>, it was suggested that he should be
buried at Siwa. However, the suggestion was not carried out and he
was buried at Alexandria, the city to which he gave his name. One
of the hills in the desert near Siwa is still called “Gebel
Sekunder,” and tradition has it that from this hill Alexander saw
the ravens which led him to the temple.</p>

<p>The ritual of the temple was somewhat similar to several other
oracular temples. The actual oracle was made in human figure, with
a ram’s head, richly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
ornamented with emeralds and other precious stones. The figure of
the god appears to have been shown as though wrapped for burial,
and this dead god, who was a god of prophecy, may possibly have set
the fashion of menes-worship which one still sees in Siwa when
natives resort to the graves of their ancestors in order to learn
the future. When a distinguished pilgrim arrived for a consultation
the symbol of the god was brought up from the inmost sanctuary of
the temple and carried on a golden barque, hung with votive cups of
silver, followed by a procession of eighty priests and many singing
girls, “who chanted uncouth songs after the manner of their
country,” in order to propitiate the deity and induce him to return
a satisfactory answer. The god directed the priests who carried the
barque which way they should proceed, and spoke by tremulous
shocks, communicated to the bearers, and by movements of the head
and body, which were interpreted by the priests.</p>

<p>Those spaces among the palm groves at Aghourmi must have
witnessed in ancient days many a splendid spectacle. One can
imagine the magnificent ceremonies and the awe-inspiring rites
which were solemnized among the shady vistas of tall palm trees, in
the shadow of the great temple on the rock, the processions of
chanting priests, the savage music of conches and cymbals, and the
gorgeous caravans of Eastern monarchs, carrying offerings of
fabulous treasure to lay before the mystic oracle of the oasis,
whose infallible answers were regarded by the whole<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> world with profound respect. In
those days caravans from the West, and from the savage countries of
the Sudan, brought slaves and merchandize to Siwa, and the
barbarian followers of African chieftains mingled with the
courtiers of Eastern potentates, and gazed with awe on the
white-robed priests and the troops of pale singing girls. To-day
the people of Aghourmi build their fires against the great
crumbling archways that gave access to the holiest altar of
Ammonium, and shepherds graze their flocks among the ruins of the
smaller temple.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Towards the end of the third century <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> the fame of the oracle declined, although,
according to Juvenal, the answers of Ammon were esteemed in the
solution of difficult problems until long after the cessation of
the oracle at Delphi. But in the second century <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> the oracle was almost extinct. Strabo, writing
when its fame was on the wane, advances a theory in his
<em>Geography</em> that the Temple of Ammon was originally close to
the sea. He bases his argument on the existence of large salt lakes
at Siwa and the quantities of shells which are to be found near the
temple. He considers that Siwa would never have become so
illustrious, or possessed with such credit as it once enjoyed, if
it had always been such a distance from the coast, therefore the
land between Siwa and the sea must have been created<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> comparatively recently by
deposits from the ocean. Undoubtedly at some remote period the
whole of the northern part of the Libyan Desert was under the sea,
but there is nothing to prove that even then Siwa was a coast town,
because one finds shells and fossils, such as Strabo mentions, over
a hundred miles south of Siwa.</p>

<p>The Romans neglected Oriental oracles, especially those of
Ammon. They preferred the auguries of birds, the inspection of
victims and the warnings of heaven to the longer process of
oracular consultation. In the reign of Augustus, Siwa had become a
place of banishment for political criminals. Timasius, an eminent
general, was sent there in <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 396 and
Athanasius addresses several letters to his disciples who were
banished to the oases, “a place unfrequented and inspiring horror.”
The French poet Fénelon, in his play, <em>The Adventures of
Telemachus</em>, makes the mistake of describing Siwa as a place
where one sees “snow that never melts, making an endless winter on
the mountain tops.”</p>

<p>Somewhere about the fourth century Christianity penetrated to
Siwa, and the ruins of a church, or monastery, built probably at
this time, where one can still distinguish the Coptic cross carved
in stone, are visible at Biled el Roumi, near Khamissa. The ruin is
described in the Arabic history as the place where “bad people”
lived. But apparently Christianity was never embraced with much
zeal. During the Berber uprisings in the sixth century Siwa
relapsed into barbarism, and the Siwans probably<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> took part with the Berbers in
their struggles against the Byzantine rule which flourished on the
coast. Early in the seventh century, when the Arab army invaded
Egypt, the inland country west of Egypt was practically
independent, the Berber tribes having won back their freedom.</p>

<h3><a id="c03s2"></a>(2)</h3>

<p class="sch3">SECOND PERIOD</p>

<p class="sch2">Mediæval Siwa</p>

<p>The second period of Siwa’s history is the most difficult to
trace, especially with regard to the fixing of definite dates. One
has to depend on the Arabic history at Siwa, and occasional highly
coloured references to the oasis by the Arab historians and
geographers. Siwa was known to the Arab writers as “Schantaria,” or
“Santrieh,” spelt in various ways, which at a later date became
“Siouah,” and finally “Siwa.”</p>

<p>In 640 Egypt was invaded by a Mohammedan army commanded by
Amrou, who seized the country from the feeble grasp of the
representatives of Heraclius. The tide of conquest swept west along
the northern coast of Africa. The disunion of the Berber tribes
made the conquest of the country more easy for the host of Islam.
Fugitives from the Arabs fled inland to the remote places such as
the oases, and it was not until several centuries later that the
Arabs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> established
their religion in Siwa. According to the Arabic history when Egypt
was invaded by the Mohammedans the Siwans sent an army to help
repel the enemy, but this army, like many others, was lost in the
desert.</p>

<p>Mohammed Ben Ayas, an Arab historian who wrote in 1637, gives an
account of the mysterious country of “Santarieh,” and describes how
Moussa Ibn Nosseir was repulsed from its gates. In 708 Moussa
attempted to reduce Siwa. He crossed the desert from Egypt in seven
days. On arrival he found that all the Siwans had retired into
their fortified town, which was surrounded by enormously high
walls, with four iron gates. Finding it impossible to force an
entrance he ordered his men to scale the walls and see what lay on
the other side. With the aid of ladders they managed to reach the
battlements, but each man who scaled the wall immediately
disappeared over the other side and was never seen again. Moussa
was so discouraged by this that he renounced his project and
returned to Egypt, having lost a large number of soldiers. In 710
Tharic Ben Sayed, another Arab general, was also repulsed.</p>

<p>The mediæval Arab writers have many stories to tell of the
strange things at Siwa. Among the wonders of the country was a
magic lake over which no bird could fly without falling in, and it
could only escape from the water if drawn out by a human hand. The
four gates of the town were surmounted by four brass statues. When
a stranger entered the gates a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_91">[91]</span> deep sleep fell upon him, and he remained in
this state until one of the inhabitants came and blew upon his
face. Without this attention he lay unconscious at the foot of the
statue until death claimed him. There was a sacred stone in the
town which was called “The Lover,” because of its strange power of
attracting men. It drew them towards itself, and then when they
touched it their limbs stuck to the stone. Struggles were of no
avail, their only release was death. The neighbouring country was
full of wild beasts, and serpents of prodigious length, with bodies
as thick as palm trunks, dwelt among the hills and devoured sheep,
cattle and human beings. Another species was particularly fond of
eating camels. In one of the gardens there flourished a marvellous
orange tree which bore 14,000 oranges, not including those that
fell to the ground, every year. The author who mentions this tree
asserts that he saw it himself!</p>

<p>All the Arab writers mention the mines at Siwa. Among the
mountains that enclose the oasis people found iron, lapis lazulis
and emeralds, which they sold in Egypt. They also exported the salt
which they picked up on the ground, and obtained barley from Egypt
in exchange. The only manufactures were leather carpets of great
beauty, which were much prized by Egyptians.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Siwa were Berbers; they worked naked in their
gardens; the country was independent, thinly populated and showed
signs of a former civilization. A strange breed of
savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> donkey,
striped black and white—zebras—lived in the oasis. These animals
allowed no one to mount them, and when taken to Egypt they died at
once.</p>

<p>People used to find enchanted cities in the desert near Siwa,
but latterly they have disappeared and their positions are now only
marked by mounds of sand. Abdel Melik, Ibn Merouan, made an
excursion from Egypt into the desert near Siwa, where he discovered
a ruined city and a tree that bore every known fruit. He gathered
some fruit and returned to Fostat—Cairo. A Copt told him that this
city contained much treasure, so he sent out the Copt with a number
of men provisioned for thirty days to rediscover the place, but
they failed to find it. On another occasion an Arab was journeying
near Siwa and suddenly saw a loaded camel disappear into a deep,
rocky valley in the middle of the desert. He followed it and
arrived at an oasis watered by a spring where there were people
cultivating the land. They had never seen a stranger before. He
returned to Egypt and reported the matter to the collector of
taxes, who immediately sent out men to visit this oasis, but, as
usual, they never found it.</p>

<p>There are innumerable stories of hidden cities in the desert
near Siwa. This idea, and that of buried treasure, appeals strongly
to an Oriental mind. Siwa itself, owing to its history, probably
does contain a great deal that could be advantageously excavated.
It is a field that would yield many treasures, as up to now no
really thorough work has been carried out, though various people
who have happened to be<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_93">[93]</span> there have “done a little digging.” The
ex-Khedive spent some money in uncovering some old ruins near one
of the lakes, but really there is a great deal that has never been
touched. Labour, and the difficulty of reaching Siwa, are the most
formidable obstacles to any excavating projects.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that nearly all the mediæval Arab
historians mention the emerald mines at Siwa, and in these days the
natives still hold a belief in their existence. In the time of the
Temple of Jupiter Ammon the figure of the god was decorated with
emeralds, which were probably found in the country. According to a
Siwan tradition there exists a cave in the hill called Gebel
Dakrour, south of Aghourmi, which contains precious stones. But its
entrance is guarded by a jinn, who makes it invisible except to a
person who has drunk from the water of a certain spring among the
sand-dunes south of Siwa. The spring is unknown in these days, but
I have seen it marked on an old map of the desert. Possibly some of
the peculiar shafts that pierce the hills round Siwa are the
remains of old mines; it is difficult to imagine what else they
could be.</p>

<p>In 1048 the tribes of Hilal and Ben Soleim, who had been
transported from Arabia as a punishment, and were living in the
country between the Nile and the Red Sea, were given permission to
cross the Nile and advance into Tripoli. Some 200,000 of them
hastened like hungry wolves with their wives and families from
Egypt to the west. They overran Tripoli and pushed on towards the
shores of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Atlantic. It was some of these colonists who eventually forced Siwa
to accept the Mohammedan rule, and by 1100, according to the Arab
historians, the Koran flourished within the precincts of the Temple
of Ammon. From that date onwards Siwa has been fanatically
Mohammedan. The Siwans were not swept into oblivion by this great
Arab invasion; apparently only a very few Arabs remained in the
oasis, and very shortly they themselves became indistinguishable
from the Siwans. From this time the Berbers, as a nation, ceased to
exist, but they remained Berbers, not Arabs, and in a few
out-of-the-way places, such as Siwa, they retained much of their
original language.</p>

<p>The history at Siwa tells how one Rashwan was King of Siwa when
the Mohammedan army arrived, commanded by the Prophet’s khalifa.
Rashwan summoned his priests and magicians and consulted them as to
how the enemy were to be repelled. Acting on their advice he
removed all the bodies from “Gebel Muta,” a hill near Siwa which is
honeycombed with rock tombs, and cast them into the springs in
order to poison the enemy. Then he retired into the town, depending
on the wells inside the walls. The Mohammedan army arrived, but the
water of the springs did them no harm. They stormed the town and
captured it after a strenuous fight; Rashwan was killed, and the
inhabitants embraced the faith of Islam at the sword’s point.</p>

<p>During the period that followed the Arab invasion very little is
known of Siwa. The oasis was inhabited<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_95">[95]</span> by a mixture of Berbers and Arabs, the
Berbers predominating. Occasional caravans of slave-traders passed
northwards along the main desert routes, and some of the slaves,
having been bought by the Siwans, remained in the oasis and
intermarried with the inhabitants. The Siwans, diminished in
numbers and in power, began to suffer from raids by the Arabs from
the west and from the coast.</p>

<p>According to the old history, which is preserved at Siwa, there
was another small incursion from the east at a later date. About
the middle of the fifteenth century there was a great plague which
carried off a number of Siwans. A certain devout man in Egypt
dreamed that the ground at Siwa was very rich. He came to the oasis
and settled there, planting a special kind of date palm which he
brought from Upper Egypt; he also grew dates for the
“Wakf”—religious foundation—of the Prophet, which custom still
continues. Later he made the pilgrimage and described the country
of Siwa to the people of Mecca, who had never heard of it. They did
him great honour. He returned to Siwa accompanied by thirty men,
Berbers and Arabs, who settled in Siwa. They built an olive press
in the centre of the high town and inscribed their names thereon.
From these men, and their Siwan wives, certain of the present
inhabitants are descended, and some Siwans boast to-day that their
forebears came with “The Thirty” whose names were inscribed on the
old olive press. “The Thirty” occupied the western part of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> town, and the
original Siwans remained in the eastern quarter and in the village
of Aghourmi. Later the Siwans elected a council and chose a
“Kadi”—judge—who drew up a code of laws.</p>

<p>Under this government the population increased and the people
flourished again; they treated travellers well, especially pilgrims
from the west on their way to Mecca. The people of Tripoli came to
hear of them, and they made an alliance together. Siwa became a
“Zawia”—religious dependency—of Tripoli, and the Siwans fought in
the army of Tripoli. Siwa once more became a market for slaves and
a halting-place for the caravans from the south and the west.
Slaves came in great numbers from Wadai and the Sudan, via Kufra,
Jalo and Jerabub. Egyptian merchants came to Siwa bringing
merchandise, and returned to Egypt with slaves and dates. From the
Sudan came ivory, gold, leather and ostrich feathers.</p>

<p>During the time of Sidi Suliman, a very devout Kadi, the savage
people of Tebu, in the south, made constant raids upon Siwa, and
troubled the people greatly. On one occasion it was known that a
large army of the enemy were advancing on the oasis. The venerable
judge offered up prayers for help against the enemy, and every man
in Siwa went to the mosques. As a consequence the whole army was
buried in the sand and the road they came by was blotted out. Sidi
Suliman encouraged his people to show hospitality to strangers, but
some years after his death the people, forgetting his
injunctions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> drove
away from the gates some poor Arab pilgrims who sought their
hospitality. It is said that the door of Sidi Suliman’s tomb
miraculously closed, marking the strong displeasure of the saint,
nor did it open until the Arabs had been brought in and hospitably
entertained. According to another legend Sidi Suliman, whilst
walking near the town, suddenly became thirsty. There was no water
at hand so he struck the ground seven times with his staff, and
fresh water gushed forth, which flows in that place to-day. Before
Sidi Suliman was born his mother felt a frantic desire to eat some
fish. There was none in the town, and the sea lay 200 miles
distant. The woman seemed on the point of death. Suddenly a pigeon
flew through the open window of her room and deposited a large fish
on the floor. She ate the fish, recovered, and Sidi Suliman was
born. For this reason all Siwan women eat fish when they are
pregnant, hoping that their offspring may be such another as Sidi
Suliman. These, and many other legends, are told of Sidi Suliman,
who has become the most venerated patron sheikh of the Siwans.</p>

<p>The system of living in Siwa in those days was very curious. The
high town existed, with a thin fringe of buildings huddled at the
foot of the walls. None of the suburbs, such as Sebukh or Manshia,
were built. At night all flocks and cattle were driven within the
walls. Married men only, with their wives and families, lived in
the high town. Unmarried men, youths over fifteen years of age
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> widowers shaved
their heads, as a distinction, and occupied the houses outside the
walls. The town was one vast harem. After sunset no bachelors were
allowed inside the gates, and any man who divorced his wife was
cast out—until he bought a new one. The bachelors, who were known
as “Zigale,” formed a kind of town guard. On the approach of
strangers they sallied out to meet them and detained them until the
council of sheikhs had decided whether they were to be permitted to
enter the town. Strangers were almost always accommodated outside
the walls. There was one family of Siwans who were always
interpreters, for in those days, unlike to-day, hardly any of the
natives spoke any language but their own. The council of sheikhs
met in a room close to the main gate of the town, and near it there
was a deep, dark pit which served as a prison.</p>

<p>After Sidi Suliman a number of other kadis ruled in the oasis.
One of them was called Hassan Mitnana, and during his lifetime a
great quarrel arose between the eastern and western factions of the
town. This began in about the year 1700. The dispute originated
about a road which divides the town into two parts. A family on the
eastern side wished to enlarge their house by building out into the
street. Their opposite neighbours objected to the public
thoroughfare being narrowed merely in order to enlarge a private
dwelling-place. There was a dispute, a quarrel, and a fight in
which the two sides of the street took part. One side called
themselves “Sherkyn”—the Easterners—and the other<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> side called themselves
“Gharbyn”—the Westerners. The whole population took up the quarrel,
which developed into a permanent civil war. At times it died down
and seemed on the point of extinction, then, quite suddenly, it
flamed up, ending in pitched battles in the space before the town,
where the casualties were often very severe considering the
smallness of the population.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw7">
<figure id="i10"><img src='images/i10.jpg' alt=''>
<p class="cp1">THE CITADEL AND THE MOSQUE OF EL ATIK</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Before the days of gunpowder these battles were fought in an
open space below the walls of the town. On an appointed day the two
opposing armies faced one another. The men stood in front, armed
with swords and spears, the women collected behind the men,
carrying bags full of stones which they hurled at the enemy, or at
anyone on their own side who showed signs of cowardice. Platoons,
each of a few dozen men, advanced in turn and fought in the space
midway between the two armies, then gradually the whole of both
forces became engaged. The women displayed great fierceness; they
often joined in the fray, beating out the life from any of their
enemies who they found lying wounded, with sharp stones. It seems
amazing that, notwithstanding these frequent battles, the Siwans
managed to live in such a confined space, so close together.</p>

<p>It is only during the last few years of peaceful government,
since the war, that the violent animosity between the two parties
has died down. A few families of opposing parties have
intermarried, but even now one rarely meets a western sheikh
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> the eastern
quarter, or vice versa. Both quarters are entirely self-supporting.
They have their own wells, olive presses, mosques and date
markets.</p>

<p>At the time of writing I hear from Siwa that a few months after
I left there was another outbreak between east and west. Some
eastern men were riding home from their gardens, excited by
“lubki”—palm wine. They rode through the streets of the western
quarter, shouting and singing. The western people took this as an
insult and attacked them. In ten minutes 800 men had collected in
the square, the east and the west facing each other. A fierce fight
began, but fortunately, as the men were only armed with sticks and
tools, there were no fatal injuries. The local police and the mamur
were unable to do anything, and the Egyptian officials retired to
the Markaz—Government Office. A few minutes later the Camel Corps
arrived with fixed bayonets and dispersed the crowd. There were
about fifty cases needing hospital treatment, some of them being
quite severe.</p>

<p>Such were the lively conditions of internecine warfare when
Browne, the first Englishman to visit Siwa, arrived at the oasis in
1792. He came in disguise with a caravan from Egypt. But against an
infidel, a common foe, the Siwans stood united. Browne’s identity
was discovered; he was received with stones and abuse, roughly
treated, and sent back to Egypt without having seen much of the
oasis. But during his brief stay he formed no favourable opinion of
the people. They were notorious for<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_101">[101]</span> their monstrous arrogance, intense bigotry
and gross immorality.</p>

<p>Six years later Hornemann, of the African Association, arrived
at Siwa, travelling in the guise of a young mameluke, with a
pilgrim caravan on its way from Mecca to the kingdom of Fezzan. He
described Siwa as a small independent state, acknowledging the
Sultan, but paying no tribute. He estimated the population at 8000
persons. The Siwans were governed by a council of sheikhs, who held
their meetings and trials in public, and flew to arms on the
slightest provocation when they disagreed. When Hornemann left Siwa
he was followed by the inhabitants who apparently suspected his
identity. “The braying of several hundred asses heralded the
approach of the Siwan Army.” With great difficulty he persuaded the
sheikhs that his passport from Napoleon Buonaparte was really a
firman from the Sultan. They finally allowed him to proceed on his
way. He sent his papers to Europe from Tripoli, but he himself
perished while exploring North Africa. It is very curious that most
of the few Europeans who visited Siwa in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries were Germans.</p>

<p>The difficulties that meet a European travelling in the guise of
a Mohammedan are not so formidable as they would appear. Knowledge
of the language would seem to be the greatest stumbling-block. But
in North Africa there are so many dialects, and so many different
pronunciations, that an Arab from one part of the desert would find
it difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
understand an Arab from another district, and the difference in the
accent or pronunciation of an Egyptian from Cairo and a European
speaking Arabic, would not be recognized in many of the more remote
districts.</p>

<p class="center less spaced2">“A house divided against itself
cannot stand.”</p>

<p>In the year 1816 there was a great fight between the two
factions, in which the easterners gained the day. Ali Balli, a
western sheikh, went to Egypt and described to the Government the
independent state of Siwa and the condition of anarchy prevalent
there. In 1820 Mohammed Ali invaded the Sudan. In order to protect
his western flank he sent a force of 1300 men, with some cannon,
commanded by Hassein Bey Shemishera, one of his generals, against
the fanatical population of Siwa. They crossed the desert via Wadi
Natrun and the oasis of Gara. A few of the western faction welcomed
the army, but most of the population prepared to fight. After a
desperate battle, lasting for several hours, the Siwans were
severely beaten, and from that date Siwa was permanently secured to
Egypt. The Turks entered the town, seized the principal men, and in
course of time some sixty of the notables were executed
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> Hassein Bey, who
punished by death on the least suspicion of rebellion or revolt. A
tribute was imposed on Siwa, and Sheikh Ali Balli was made omda,
supported by the Turks. After some time Hassein Bey and the army
returned to Egypt. The Siwans promptly refused to pay tribute, so
in 1827 Hassein Bey returned with a force of 800 men, occupied the
town after a brief contest, executed eighteen of the notables,
confiscated their property, but paid the widows of the unfortunate
men ten pounds each as full compensation for the life of a Siwan
notable. He also banished twenty of the sheikhs, increased the
tribute, and appointed a Turkish officer as Governor of Siwa, with
a small force. Under Hassein Bey the Siwans suffered considerably.
He seized their money, slaves, dates and silver ornaments, which he
sent to his home in Egypt. He built the first “Markaz”—Government
Office—whose ruins stand behind the Kasr Hassuna, the present
District Officer’s house, where I lived.</p>

<p>During the nineteenth century several Europeans visited Siwa,
but they met with no encouragement and were in most cases badly
treated. One of them, Butin, a French colonel, carried on his
camels a collapsible boat in which he hoped to reach the island on
the salt lake of Arashieh, which according to legends contained
fabulous treasure and the sword and seal of Mohammed. He managed to
bring the boat to Siwa, but the natives refused to let him embark.
These early travellers all mention the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_104">[104]</span> subterranean passages connecting Aghourmi
and Omm Beyda, also between Siwa town and the Hill of the Dead. The
natives described these passages as having “biute”—houses—or
possibly burying spaces, opening out on either side. The entrances
have now in all cases been blocked up by stones and rubbish, but
with a little labour they could easily be excavated. Several old
men in Siwa know the exact position of the entrances to these
passages, which I have seen myself.</p>

<p>The successor of Hassein Bey was Farag Kashif, who built a
causeway across one of the salt lakes, making each family work on
it in turn. It is a useful piece of work, a narrow path, wide
enough for two camels to pass abreast, supported by rough stakes
and palm logs, crossing the salt bog which would otherwise be
impassable. Several more mamurs were appointed, but they were mere
figureheads, as all the power lay in the hands of the omda, Ali
Balli. Each year that the taxes were unpaid, and this was frequent,
a punitive expedition arrived from Egypt.</p>

<p>The omda was hated by most of the Siwans, who held him
responsible for the Turkish occupation, and the years of
oppression. Knowing his unpopularity he never left his house after
sunset. Certain of the eastern sheikhs bribed two young western men
to lure him from his house at night. They persuaded him to come to
Mesamia, a narrow tunnel in the western quarter, and there they
stabbed him to death. Yousif Ali, the omda’s son, demanded blood
money, or the surrender of his father’s murderers, but
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> eastern sheikhs
refused and secretly sent the men to Derna. Then followed a few
years with neither omda nor mamur, and a government, of sorts, by a
council of sheikhs.</p>

<p>Yousif Ali was a clever, ambitious man. Bayle St. John, who
visited Siwa in 1849, described him as “a broad, pale-faced man,
with a sly, good-humoured expression, of ambitious character, with
speech full of elegant compliments.” He wore a tarbouch, a white
burnous and carried a blunderbuss. Except for the blunderbuss the
description would suit several of the present-day Siwan notables.
For seven years he went every winter to Cairo, trying to persuade
the Government to make him omda in place of his father. He earned
the nickname of “The Schemer.” He spent a great deal of money on
bribes in Egypt, but was always unsuccessful.</p>

<p>In the year 1852 Hamilton, an English traveller, came to Siwa on
his way back to Egypt, after journeying in Tripoli and North
Africa. In his <em>Wanderings in North Africa</em> he devotes
several pages to his experiences in Siwa. The following version of
what happened to him is told there now by the Siwans. He pitched
his camp near the Markaz, half a mile south of the town. The Siwans
bitterly resented any European visitors, so Yousif Ali, knowing
this, collected the fighting men and deliberately inflamed their
anger against the stranger who had come to spy out their land; he
urged them that it was their duty to kill the “Unbeliever,” so they
determined to make a night attack on Hamilton’s camp.
Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> Yousif Ali
secretly warned Hamilton of the intended attack, and persuaded him
to take shelter in his house. Hamilton left his tents standing
empty, and during the night the “Zigale”—fighting men—opened fire
on them, but the Englishman was safely lodged in Yousif Ali’s
house. Thus Yousif Ali gained credit for having saved Hamilton from
the attack which he himself had instigated. This is a
characteristic example of Siwan diplomacy.</p>

<p>After the attack the Siwans refused to let Hamilton leave the
town, and for six weeks he was practically a prisoner in a little
house adjoining that of Yousif Ali. During this time the people
amused themselves by shooting and throwing stones at his windows,
and collecting in crowds to stare and jeer at the
“Nosrani”—Christian. Matters became worse and the most fanatical
sheikhs on the town council advocated his execution. With great
difficulty he managed to send two letters, by slaves, to the
Viceroy of Egypt; but he spent an anxious time as the days passed
and no answer came. The Siwans found out about the letters, and as
time passed and it became more and more probable that the
messengers were lost, so the people became more and more insolent.
Some of the sheikhs offered to lend him camels to escape from the
town, on the condition that he first wrote to the Viceroy saying
that he had been well treated. They intended to murder him as soon
as he left the town, and to secure his baggage for themselves, but
he discovered the plot and refused to leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>One day an
abnormally hot wind rose from the south and blew with great
violence for three days. This was taken as a serious omen of coming
disaster. The idea that a sudden violent wind, stirred by an evil
“jinn,” foreshadows a catastrophe, is implicitly believed by the
Siwans and by all Berbers. A number of Siwans who had been most
aggressive hurriedly left the town, and the remainder endeavoured,
to the best of their ability, to conciliate Hamilton. The sheikhs
who had been most vindictive now fawned upon their “guest,” who
became a person to be conciliated instead of a despised Christian.
Evidently they had secret news of the approach of a party of
cavalry from Egypt. On the 14th March, 1852, two sheikhs arrived
and announced the approach of 150 irregular cavalry, who with 14
officers had been dispatched by the Viceroy to effect his release,
in response to Hamilton’s letter. A week later, with much
“fantasia” and display, the army left Siwa accompanied by Hamilton
and Yousif Ali. The Turkish Commandant, with typically stupid
obstinacy, refused to take any prisoners, but bound over a number
of the sheikhs to appear in Egypt in two months’ time. Needless to
say they failed to appear.</p>

<p>Shortly after Hamilton arrived in Cairo the Viceroy sent another
expedition of 200 men to bring back a number of Siwan notables to
answer for their conduct. The army reached the oasis and camped at
Ain Megahiz. The Siwans retired into their fortress town. A certain
Arab sheikh, who knew<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_108">[108]</span> Siwa and was with the Turkish expedition,
went down to the town and persuaded forty of the leading men to
come out to the camp and see the Commandant. He successfully
tricked them with a promise of a favourable treaty, and they
believed him. On arrival at the camp they were arrested and thrown
into chains; the army entered the town without opposition, as the
people, having lost their leaders, had no heart to fight. As
before, the Turks spoiled the people, the soldiers robbed the
inhabitants, seized the women, and shot down anyone who opposed
them. Then at last Sheikh Yousif Ali was appointed Omda of Siwa by
the Government of Egypt.</p>

<p>Some years later, in 1854, Abbas, son of Mohammed Ali, died, and
was succeeded by his son, Said Pasha. The latter, on his accession,
granted an amnesty under which the Siwan notables, who had been
condemned to hard labour and were working as prisoners, were
released. They hurried back to their oasis, eager to be revenged on
Yousif Ali. On arrival they were joined by their slaves and
retainers, but met with considerable opposition from the
westerners. For three days there was sporadic fighting, then they
surrounded the omda’s house. But Yousif Ali had fled to the house
of one of his supporters in the suburb, called Manshiah, and
garrisoned it with his few remaining slaves. His friends among the
western sheikhs deserted him, seeing that popular opinion was
entirely against him. From the house in Manshiah, which is a
miniature fortress, he sent his two young daughters to
bribe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> the mamur to
help him. The mamur was the same Arab who had betrayed the forty
sheikhs, and was busy enough looking after himself. The two girls
were caught by the eastern sheikhs. One of them was persuaded to go
back to her father’s house, and at a given signal to let in the
enemy. They surrounded Manshiah and forced an entry to the house.
The slaves stopped fighting and surrendered. Yousif Ali was caught
on the roof, trying to escape; he was dragged down through the
house, out into the street and strangled.</p>

<p>The news of this outrage reached Egypt, and in 1857 a new mamur
arrived with a detachment of soldiers. The system of two omdas
ruling at once, one eastern and one western, was tried, but found
to be a failure. The force under the mamur was quite inadequate to
collect the taxes or to keep order. The post was an unpopular one,
and was considered, as it is now, a form of exile by the Egyptian
mamurs who detest a place that has not the liveliness and
amusements of Cairo, or a provincial town. All the mamurs at Siwa
used constantly to say to me, “Saire—Siwa ees what you call
exile!”</p>

<p>There followed in quick succession a series of somewhat
incompetent Turkish mamurs who were in most cases quite powerless
to keep under this turbulent town and population. To add to their
difficulties the power of the Senussi sect was beginning to make
itself firmly felt, and this complicated still more the political
situation in the oasis. The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_110">[110]</span> Senussi brethren at Jerabub were regarded
by the Siwans as the ultimate arbitrators in any disputes which
arose among the people, thus ignoring the jurisdiction of the
Turkish Government officials. One mamur married, on the day of his
arrival, a girl of the eastern quarter, and oppressed the
westerners to such a degree that they obtained his recall from
Egypt. He was sent back to Egypt, and as he entered the Governor’s
house in Alexandria one of his men stepped forward and shot him.
Another mamur infuriated the people by wishing to demolish the tomb
of Sidi Suliman, in order to build a house on the site. He made all
preparations for the work, but on the night before the building
began he died mysteriously, possibly from poison. Another mamur
imitated the Siwans in every way—eating, dressing and speaking as
one. He kept his position for fourteen years, becoming very popular
on account of the interest he took in the well-being of the people.
But few of the mamurs were liked; they generally sided definitely
with one faction or the other, which resulted in intrigue against
them by the opposite faction, who tried to procure their
dismissal.</p>

<p>In 1896 Mustapha Mahr, Governor of the Behera Province, was
dispatched to Siwa, with fifty soldiers, to inquire into certain
disorders. He arrived to find Siwa in an uproar, the administration
of justice at a standstill, and three years’ taxes unpaid. A
powerful western sheikh, Hassuna Mansur, had retired to his
stronghold, Kasr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Hassuna, a fortress on an isolated rock south of the town, with a
large number of slaves and adherents. He refused to pay taxes and
defied the Egyptian Government. This individual became the nucleus
of opposition. He was besieged; but friends among the besiegers
supplied him with water, and even helped him when he sallied out
from his fortress and carried away corn, sheep and cattle from the
neighbourhood. The Turkish official was helpless. Mustapha Mahr and
his fifty men were unable to cope with the rebel. On the advice of
the sheikhs he appealed to the Senussi brethren at Jerabub, and
very soon Sheikh Ahmed Ibn Idris, a relation by marriage to Sheikh
El Senussi, appeared on the scene. The Turkish Commandant asked his
assistance. Sheikh Ahmed ordered Hassuna to surrender, which he did
at once, and after much discussion an agreement was made, signed by
the Senussi sheikh, by which the Siwans promised to pay taxes, but
on the condition that they should not be retrospective. The Senussi
sheikh then returned triumphantly to Jerabub. This illustrates
conclusively the power of the Senussi at this period. A few months
later another dispute arose, about some goats, which ended in a
battle between east and west, in which Hassuna Mansur was slain,
and with him over 100 Siwans.</p>

<p>In 1898, five years after the death of this firebrand of the
desert, another affair began which is known as the “Widow’s War.”
The Omda of Siwa died leaving a son, Mohammed Said, and a wealthy
young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> widow of
great personal attractions. An eastern Siwan, named Ahmed Hamza,
wished to marry her. It was considered a suitable match, and all
her relations approved, except her stepson, Mohammed Said, who was
supported by the Medinia sect of Siwans, who had another
prospective husband. One night she disappeared. It was found that
she had fled to the house of Osman Habun, a very powerful western
sheikh, the most influential man in Siwa, who was the
representative of the Senussi. The son demanded his mother from the
Habun family, who refused to surrender her. The war drums were
beaten, and a fight between east and west was imminent. But at the
last moment Habun surrendered the woman, who returned to her own
house. On the next day she ran away again; this time she went to
the house of a western Siwan, called Abdulla Mansur, whom she
wished to marry, although she herself should have held no views on
the subject. The whole town was disturbed by the widow’s unseemly
behaviour. Finally her stepson forced her to marry the man whom he
had chosen, and the widow retired from the scene.</p>

<p>But Ahmed Hamza resented losing her, and in revenge, some of his
friends attacked some relations of Mohammed Said’s, on the road to
Aghourmi, and killed two of them. Then Mohammed Said, with the
easterners, raided the western gardens, and the westerners
retaliated by carrying off sheep and cattle. The war drums were
beaten, which signal meant that every man must be ready and armed
within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> twenty-four
hours; flags were displayed on the western hill and on the highest
fort of the eastern quarter, and the doors leading into the street
that divides the town were barred with palm logs. At the end of the
twenty-four hours the eastern force assembled on Shali—the high
town—and the western forces stationed themselves on their rock. The
easterners opened fire and shot, by mistake, a small Arab boy. A
truce was called while both parties discussed the compensation. But
during the truce an eastern man, going out to his garden, was
killed by a party of westerners, so the fight began again, both
sides firing across the street with long, Arab guns and
old-fashioned blunderbusses. The Turkish mamur and his little force
retired to the Markaz, well out of harm’s way.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw3">
<figure id="i11"><img src='images/i11.jpg' alt=''>
<p class="cp1">GATE INTO THE WESTERN QUARTER</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The westerners had only one good spring within convenient reach
of the town. They posted a guard round it, and the easterners, not
expecting to meet with resistance, made a sortie, intending to
capture the spring. The attacking party was beaten off and driven
away from the town towards the gardens. The rest of the easterners,
seeing their comrades in flight, came down from the town and
followed after them. Then the entire western force, led by their
chief, Osman Habun, on his great white war-horse, the only one in
Siwa, surged out of the town, through the narrow gates, firing and
shrieking, waving swords and spears, followed by their women
throwing stones. Every able-bodied man and woman joined in the
battle beneath the walls, and only a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_114">[114]</span> few old men and children remained on the
battlements watching the fight.</p>

<p>After a fierce combat, lasting for nearly a day, resulting in
many casualties, the western force was beaten back towards the
town, and “The Habun” found himself in danger of being captured.
The western women had followed their men out from the town and were
watching the battle from the gardens. Habun’s mother, seeing her
son in danger, collected a dozen women of his house and managed to
get near him. He left his horse and slipped into the gardens where
he joined the women. They dressed him as a girl, and with them he
escaped to the tomb of Sidi Suliman, where he hid. While in hiding
Habun communicated with the Senussi brethren at Jerabub, who
intervened and patched up a peace. Nowadays, if one wants to insult
one of the Habun family, there is no surer method than by inquiring
who it was who escaped from a battle disguised as a woman.</p>

<p>After this the Egyptian Government realized that a stronger
force was needed to keep order in Siwa, so they sent some more men
and a few cavalry. The Senussi Government also tried to make a
lasting peace between east and west. Sheikh Osman Habun, agent of
the Senussi in Siwa, was at this time the most wealthy and powerful
man in the oasis. He was a large landowner and employed a small
army of slaves. He was related by marriage to most of the western
sheikhs, and many of the Siwan notables were beholden to him for
financial assistance. From his large fortified house in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> town he
dominated the western faction, and his armoury included some modern
weapons which he had stolen from a certain English traveller. In
appearance he was a fine, handsome man, with a masterful manner and
a commanding presence. When he went abroad a numerous retinue
followed him, and he received visitors to his house with almost
regal state. He married several times, and had nine sons and
daughters.</p>

<p>Several years before the Great War a certain Arab called Abdel
Arti, a notorious smuggler of hashish between Egypt and Tripoli,
made a raid on some bedouins who camped at Lubbok, a little oasis
where there is water and good grazing about eight miles south of
Siwa, among the sand-dunes. He called at Lubbok to get water on his
way to Egypt via the oasis of Bahrein. One of the bedouins came to
Siwa and warned the mamur, who summoned the sheikhs and the people.
Osman Habun was at this time an ally of Abdel Arti and knew his
plans. The eastern people assembled, but the westerners delayed.
Eventually, after many absurd excuses, Osman Habun arrived and
accompanied the mamur and an armed party to Lubbok; but they found
that the smugglers had escaped, carrying off several women and
leaving two of the bedouins dead on the field. The delay caused by
Osman Habun had saved Abdel Arti from capture. When they returned
the mamur held a court on Osman Habun and threatened to depose him
and make another man omda in his place. Habun retired to his
house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> and sulked,
refusing to appear again when summoned by the mamur. One of Habun’s
sons was ordered to bring his father to the Markaz, but he returned
with a message that being the month of Ramadan his father was
fasting and could not go out.</p>

<p>Then the mamur, with his few soldiers and some Sudanese camel
corps, followed by a shouting mob of Siwans, went up the steep,
dark streets that lead to the house of “The Habun.” By the time
that they had arrived night had fallen. They found the great wooden
door locked and barred, and the house full of armed men, but they
managed to break in the door and enter the ground floor. But the
stairs were strongly barricaded, so they went outside and lit
lanterns while they discussed what to do. Then the soldiers started
firing up at the windows, and the defenders fired back, people in
the adjoining houses joining in. The soldiers retreated under some
buildings across the lane, but as they did this the mamur was shot
and left lying in the narrow alley. A Camel Corps man dashed out
and dragged him into shelter. Meanwhile Osman Habun had escaped by
a private door through the mosque behind the house. Eventually the
soldiers entered the building and captured the defenders. Osman
Habun attempted to escape through the town to Jerabub, but he was
caught by Sheikh Mohammed Said, his rival of the eastern faction,
and brought a prisoner to the Markaz where the mamur lay dying. He
was tried for the murder of the mamur, found<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_117">[117]</span> guilty, and hanged, and his eldest son,
Hammado, was awarded penal servitude. He is still alive, in prison
at Tura.</p>

<p>Osman Habun was one of the biggest men that Siwa ever produced,
though he had many bad qualities. The Siwans say that he sacrificed
himself for his son, Hammado, being an old man and not willing to
see his son hanged, though Hammado is said to have killed the
mamur. Abdel Arti, the cause of the trouble, had a fight with some
of the Egyptian Coastguard Camel Corps, and killed one of them.
They met him again among the desolate sand-dunes south of Siwa, and
killed him, together with several of his followers. Their graves
are distinguishable—rough stone cairns—on the unmapped desert where
a route from Egypt to Tripoli is still called “Abdel Arti’s
Road.”</p>

<p class="sch">FOURTH PERIOD</p>

<p class="sch2">Siwa and the War</p>

<p>The history of the British operations on the Western Desert of
Egypt against the Senussi in 1915-1917 has been well described in
several books, and by people who were actually present at the
various engagements. I was not there at the time, so I am unable to
give a first-hand account of it, but no history of Siwa would be
complete without a sketch of the principal events of that campaign,
which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> one of
the most brilliant and successful “side-shows” of the Great War,
and has left a lasting impression on the Arabs of the Western
Desert, which will be remembered for many years to come.</p>

<p>After the war in Tripoli between the Italians and the Turks, in
1911, the suzerainty of Italy over Tripoli was formally
acknowledged at the Treaty of Lausanne, but although the whole of
the country became an Italian possession only the coastal towns
were held firmly. The Arabs in the south, and the Berber
inhabitants of the various oases, strongly resented the Italian
rule, and for this reason the seeds of propaganda sown by Turkish
and German agents found fertile soil among the natives of
Tripoli.</p>

<p>Germany had for a long time cast envious eyes on North Africa,
and early in the war the Germans seem to have hoped that by their
influence in the country they could stir the Arabs to sweep their
much-hated Italian masters off the coast, and to advance against
Egypt from the west. At the outbreak of war the Arabs in the south
listened readily to the Turkish agents, who encouraged them with
arms and money to revolt against the Italians and to take part in
the Holy War, which was declared by the Sultan of Turkey against
the English and the Allies. But the most important military and
political factor on the Libyan Desert was the Senussi
confraternity, and they, up to this time, had been decidedly
pro-British.</p>

<p>The Senussi confraternity was founded by Sidi Mohammed Ben Ali
es Senussi, who was born of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_119">[119]</span> Berber stock, but claimed descent from the
Prophet, in Algeria, in 1787. In 1821 he went to Fez and became
known as an ascetic religious who held severely to the simple
teachings of the Koran. Just before the French occupation of
Algeria he left his country and began travelling in North Africa,
teaching his doctrine of a pure form of Islam. The occupation of
his native country by Unbelievers probably contributed to the
dislike of Christians which characterized his later life. After
spending some years in North Africa he went to Cairo and settled at
El Azhar, the great Mohammedan university of Egypt, but his strict
ideals found no favour and his teaching was condemned by the Ulema.
From Cairo he went to Mecca, where he studied with Sidi Ahmed Ibn
Idris el Fasi, the leader of the Khadria confraternity, which had
some influence in Morocco. On the death of Sidi Ahmed, Mohammed es
Senussi became head of the sect and travelled for some years among
the bedouins of the Hedjaz. But his doctrines were too peaceable
for these fierce Arabs, and in 1838 he returned to the west and
settled at Siwa.</p>

<p>In Siwa he inhabited the caves in the limestone rock below the
Kasr Hassuna, living in one of them and using the other as an
oratory. With his own hands he carved out the nitch—or
“mihrab”—which faces Mecca. During his sojourn at Siwa he became
very ill and at one time he almost died. The people of Siwa
accepted his teachings with enthusiasm, and since then the greater
proportion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> the
population have been ardent Senussiya. For this reason it has
always been considered very dangerous for anybody who is not
exceedingly religious and virtuous to inhabit these caves in the
Kasr Hassuna.</p>

<p>When I was in the Kasr one of my servants asked for permission
to live in the cave. I reminded him of the superstition, but
allowed him to do so. It was most disastrous; after about a month
he moved out and complained to me of the persistent misfortune that
had dogged him. His wife ran away, he became ill, he had some money
stolen from him, and was badly bitten by a tarantula. Another man,
who had a reputation in the Section for being particularly
religious, moved in, but he only remained a week, and after that
the caves were left severely alone. None of the Siwans would live
in this place under any consideration, and the Siwan wife of my
Sudanese orderly lived in a little hut outside the entrance.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw1">
<figure id="i12"><img src='images/i12.jpg' alt=''>
<p class="cp1">“KASR HASSUNA,” THE DISTRICT OFFICER’S HOUSE</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>After eight months in Siwa Mohammed es Senussi went on to Jalo
and came into contact with the Zouias, a fierce and warlike race of
Arabs who held various oases in southern Tripoli. They adopted his
teachings, and in 1844 he founded his first zawia—religious
centre—at El Beda, where his eldest son was born. From this centre
the Senussi brethren carried their teachings all over Africa,
travelling with the great caravans of the merchants who traded in
slaves, ivory, arms, etc., between the Sudan, Tripoli, Wadai and
Egypt. Gradually they grew to be regarded as arbitrators in
disputes, and important cases were brought to Mohammed es Senussi
for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> judgment.
They successfully combined the duties of merchants and magistrates,
acquiring great wealth and great influence. The Senussi were at all
times opposed to luxury and intolerant of Unbelievers; they claimed
that their form of Mohammedanism was more pure than any other, and
as far as possible they kept aloof from politics.</p>

<p>In 1852 Mohammed es Senussi returned to Mecca, and shortly
afterwards he formally excommunicated the Sultan of Turkey. In 1856
he came, for the last time, to Jerabub, ninety miles west of Siwa.
He died here three years later and was buried in the tomb in the
mosque. At the time of his death his prestige was enormous;
pilgrims travelled many thousands of miles to visit Jerabub, and
Senussism had spread all over Central and North Africa. The Senussi
zawias became rich from the profits of trading and owned large
numbers of slaves, also arms and ammunition were imported from
Turkey, landed on the Tripoli coast and taken down to the south.
One of the greatest authorities on the Senussi estimated their
numbers at between one and a half and three millions at the time of
the death of Mohammed es Senussi. But their importance as a
military factor was not great; being spread over such a vast area
they lacked cohesion, and any combined action would be almost an
impossibility.</p>

<p>Mohammed es Senussi left two sons, Mohammed el Mahdi and
Mohammed el Sherif. The former succeeded his father as the leader
of the Senussi. He spent a considerable part of his life at
Jerabub,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> acquiring
great wealth and strengthening his influence by peaceable
penetration. In 1884 he refused to help the Sudanese Mahdi, who
appealed to the Senussi for assistance in driving the English out
of Egypt. If the Senussi had risen then and joined with the
Sudanese the position of Egypt would have been very dangerous.
Mohammed el Mahdi died in 1902 and was succeeded by his nephew,
Sayed Ahmed, as the son of Mohammed el Mahdi was still a boy.</p>

<p>When Sayed Ahmed succeeded, the French were pushing their
conquests inland from the coast, and the Turks were also advancing
southwards in Tripoli. Sayed Ahmed did all he could to oppose them,
but gradually he was forced to retire. One by one the various
zawias were occupied, till finally the Senussi chief was driven
back to Kufra and Jerabub. In 1911 Sayed Ahmed allied himself to
the Turks, although the Senussi had always been at enmity with
them, and when the Italians landed on the Tripoli coast the Senussi
supported the Turks in the war against the Italians, and when the
Turks were finally beaten the Senussi in the interior became once
more practically independent.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1915 the Senussi were still ostensibly at peace
with Egypt and Britain, but the pro-German agents had successfully
fomented an anti-British feeling, and the Arabs were being armed
and organized by German and Turkish officers who landed in
submarines—from Constantinople—evaded the Italians on the coast,
and went down south into<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_123">[123]</span> the Senussi country. The British and
Italian alliance was an incentive to the Arabs in Tripoli, who
bitterly resented the Italian occupation of their country.</p>

<p>Sollum, the frontier post, was garrisoned by a small detachment
of the Egyptian army and the Coastguards, native troops with two or
three English officers. In August, 1915, the crews of two English
submarines, wrecked on the coast west of Sollum, were fired upon by
the Senussi, but Sayed Ahmed apologized and declared that he did
not know what nationality the men were. In the autumn it was known
that the British attempt at Gallipoli was doomed; there was a
danger of disturbances in Egypt, and the Turks attacked the Suez
Canal.</p>

<p>On November 5th the <em>Tara</em>, an armed patrol boat, was
torpedoed off Sollum. Three of her boats came ashore a few miles
west of the frontier, and ninety-two men of the crew were captured
by some Senussi Arabs and carried inland to a place called Bir
Hakim, a well which lies about seventy miles south of the coast;
here they were kept prisoners for several months, and during this
time they suffered the most excessive privations at the hands of
their captors. They were so badly fed that they were forced to eat
snails, which are very plentiful in some parts of the desert;
several men died, and their attempts to escape were in all cases
unsuccessful. The history of their sufferings and adventures forms
the subject of two books written by one of the survivors on his
return home. Even after this incident Sidi Ahmed<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> continued to protest his
friendship for the British, and disclaimed any knowledge of the
whereabouts of the <em>Tara</em>’s crew.</p>

<p>About this time large numbers of Arabs began to collect on the
high desert above Sollum. The garrison was slightly reinforced and
some armoured cars came up the coast from Egypt. On November 23rd
Sollum was attacked by a numerous force of Senussi, armed with a
miscellaneous collection of fire-arms and some old guns. The
garrison was evacuated on to the <em>Rasheed</em>, an Egyptian
gunboat, during a heavy sand-storm, and on the same day the
garrison of Barrani was taken down the coast on another boat. They
landed at Matruh, which was put into a state of defence, and the
garrison was very soon considerably augmented by British troops who
were hurried up from Alexandria in trawlers and in cars from the
railhead. A few days after they arrived at Matruh some of the men
of the Egyptian Coastguards went over to the enemy, and Colonel
Snow Bey, of the Coastguards, was shot while speaking to some
so-called friendly Arabs on a reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Colonel Snow and Major Royle, another officer of the Coastguards
who lost his life later in the war, after joining the Flying Corps,
were both very well known on the Western Desert. As a rule, the
bedouins do not talk much of the Englishmen who lived and served
among them, but even now, several years later, one constantly hears
these two names mentioned round the camp fires of the Arabs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>While the
British force was building up the defences of Matruh, the Senussi
collected a few miles west of the town. On December 13th the
garrison advanced against the enemy, and a force of about 1300
Senussi was cleared out from a long wadi and driven off with heavy
casualties. On this occasion a squadron of Yeomanry, who were fired
on from a gully, charged at the enemy and came suddenly on a deep
and unexpected drop.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the month another large force of Arabs, under
the command of Gaffar Pasha, a Germanized Turk and a very capable
officer, occupied a valley called Wadi Majid, near Matruh. It
appeared that they intended attacking Matruh on Christmas Day, when
they supposed that the garrison would be eating and
drinking—though, as it happened, there was not even any beer in the
town. On Christmas Eve the British force, consisting of part of a
New Zealand brigade, some Sikhs, Australian Light Horse and British
Yeomanry, supported by aeroplanes and naval ships, which shelled
the enemy from the coast, went out of Matruh and fought a
successful action on Christmas Day. The Arab camp was destroyed,
and the enemy were beaten off with heavy casualties. After the
engagement the British force returned to Matruh. By this time the
usual winter weather had begun; floods of rain fell on the coast,
filling the wadis, swamping the roads and turning the country into
a morass. Once again the enemy concentrated, at a place about 26
miles west of Matruh. They were located by<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_126">[126]</span> aeroplanes, attacked and again driven
westward. On February 26th another engagement took place at Agagia,
near Barrani. The enemy lost heavily and Gaffar Pasha, the
Commander of the Senussi army, was captured during a brilliant
charge which was made by the Dorset Yeomanry. After this defeat
Sayed Ahmed, the Senussi chief, with a number of his supporters and
a huge quantity of baggage, retired from the coast, which was
getting too hot for him, and trekked across the desert down to
Siwa, travelling in great comfort with gramophones, clocks, brass
bedsteads and a large harem!</p>

<p>On arrival at Siwa he settled himself in the Kasr Hassuna, but
he lived in a very different style to his ancestor, the original
Mohammed es Senussi. A renegade Coastguard officer, Mohammed
Effendi Saleh, was appointed as his second in command. At first the
Siwans welcomed Sayed Ahmed with great enthusiasm, but their
feelings rapidly changed when the ill-disciplined mob that made up
his army took to spoiling the gardens and robbing the people.
Mohammed Saleh had been in Siwa before and he knew exactly how much
money the various inhabitants had. This acquaintance with
everybody’s financial position was of great use when he began to
extort money from the natives. Those who could not or would not pay
were beaten in the market-place and forcibly enlisted into the
army; those who paid a little were made corporals and officers, and
only the people who gave much money were exempt from service. The
richest sheikhs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
merchants were presented with Turkish and German medals and orders
and promoted to Pashas and Beys. The officers of the Senussi force
attired themselves in bright green putties, which they manufactured
from the green baize tablecloths in the offices of the Markaz; all
the files and the Government furniture, etc., was seized by Sayed
Ahmed, who carried it about with him during the rest of the
campaign, eventually leaving it at Jerabub when he finally left the
country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the campaign on the coast was going badly for the
Senussi. Barrani was occupied after the battle of Agagia, and from
there the British force, reinforced by the Duke of Westminster and
his armoured cars, pushed on towards Sollum, which was occupied on
the 14th of March. Sollum was captured by a rear attack from above
the Scarp, armoured cars and troops having managed to find a way up
the cliffs by a steep, precipitous pass known as “Negb Halfia,” or
“Hell Fire Pass,” as it was afterwards called. The Senussi blew up
their large ammunition dump at Bir Wær, on the frontier, and the
remains of their army were driven over the desert for many miles,
pursued by the British cars, which scattered them far and wide and
inspired all the Arabs with a holy dread of
“Trombiles”—motors—which will never be forgotten. The capture of
Sollum virtually ended the fighting on the coast; after that only
Siwa remained to be cleared out. The country was full of fugitives
and their starving families, who were fed and provided for by
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> British. Arab
women flocked round the garrisons at Sollum and Matruh offering
their silver ornaments and jewellery in exchange for food.</p>

<p>On April 16th, much to the relief of the inhabitants, Sayed
Ahmed left Siwa <em>en route</em> for the Dakhla oasis. He took
with him most of the able-bodied men in the place, as well as a
number of Senussi soldiers and many camel loads of luggage. The
Siwans were expected to bring their own food, but by this time they
were reduced to such a state of poverty that they had not even
enough dates to support themselves. A number of men died on the
road, and still more deserted and made their way back to the oasis.
Sayed Ahmed stayed for several months at Dakhla and then returned
to Siwa, hurrying back like a hunted hare. On each of these little
desert trips the Grand Sheikh shed a little of his baggage.</p>

<p>During his absence from Siwa the sheikhs of the Medinia sect
organized a very successful little rebellion. The people revolted
against the Senussi sheikhs who had been left in charge, drove them
into the Markaz, and besieged them for two days. Eventually peace
was made, but not before the Senussi sheikhs had sent frantic
messages to Sayed Ahmed complaining of the scandalous behaviour of
the Siwans and imploring him to return. The Siwans at the same time
sent letters to Sayed Ahmed with complaints against his sheikhs who
had stayed in Siwa to keep order. The messengers met on the road
and journeyed together till they came upon<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_129">[129]</span> Sayed Ahmed and his party between Dakhla
and Siwa. They handed their letters to the sheikh and he read them
together. The news of the “goings-on” at Siwa hastened his
return.</p>

<p>Once again he established himself in the Kasr Hassuna. Here he
indulged in severe religious observances and urged the people to
pray for divine help against the Unbelievers who had destroyed the
Senussi army on the coast. In January Sayed Ahmed and Mohammed
Saleh, his second in command, were considering retiring to Jerabub,
so as to be still further away from the British. On the 2nd of
February a force of armoured cars, lorries and light cars arrived a
few miles north of Girba, a little oasis in a deep rocky valley
north-west of Siwa. On the following day the cars successfully
descended the pass and attacked the enemy camp at Girba. The
Senussi were absolutely astounded. They had already learnt to fear
the British cars, but they never for one moment thought it possible
that a large force of motors could dash across the desert from the
coast, almost 200 miles, and attack them in their stronghold. Owing
to the rocky ground the cars were unable to get at close quarters
with the enemy. The action lasted a whole day. The Senussi, who
numbered about 800, were under the command of Mohammed Saleh, and
another force of about 500 men were at Siwa with Sayed Ahmed. At
the first alarm the Grand Sheikh bundled himself and his belongings
on to camels and fled frantically over the sand-dunes towards
Jerabub, followed by a straggling<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_130">[130]</span> mob of Arabs. On the evening of the 4th the
enemy began to retire from their position at Girba, burning arms
and ammunition before evacuating, and on the 5th of February the
cars entered Siwa and the British force was received by the sheikhs
and notables at the Markaz with expressions of relief and goodwill.
The column left the town on the same day and reached “Concentration
Point,” north of Girba, on the following day.</p>

<p>Another detachment had been sent to a pass above the western end
of the oasis in order to intercept the fugitives, but only a few
cars were able to get down from the high country above, but the one
Light Car Patrol which did descend managed to cut off a number of
the enemy who were retreating to the west. On the 8th February the
whole column went back to Sollum. The enemy’s losses were 40
killed, including 2 Senussi officers, and 200 wounded, including 5
Turkish officers. Sayed Ahmed and Mohammed Saleh both escaped, but
after this crushing defeat, and the capture of the Siwa oasis, all
danger from the Senussi forces was at an end.</p>

<p>Some time previously, after the occupation of Sollum by the
British, information was found as to the whereabouts of the
prisoners from the <em>Tara</em>, who had been joined by the
survivors of the <em>Moorina</em>, who had also landed on the coast
and had been captured by the Arabs. A force of armoured cars and
other cars, under the command of the Duke of Westminster, set off
on the 17th from Sollum with a native guide. They dashed across the
desert to Bir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Hakim, rescued the prisoners and brought them back to Sollum,
having travelled across some 120 miles of unknown desert and
attacked an enemy whose numbers they did not know. This gallant
enterprise was perhaps the most brilliant affair which occurred
during the operations on the Western Desert. The Duke of
Westminster received the D.S.O. for his exploit, and was
recommended for the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>After the capture of Siwa there was no more fighting on the
Western Desert. Sollum, Matruh and the various stations on the
coast were garrisoned with British infantry, gunners and Camel
Corps, and a standing camp of Light Cars was made at Siwa, where
they remained for some time. The F.D.A. took over the
Administration of the Western Desert, and gradually the garrisons
were withdrawn and replaced by F.D.A. Camel Corps. To-day there
only remains one small detachment of Light Car Patrols in the fort
at Sollum.</p>

<p>Sayed Ahmed and Mohammed Saleh were never captured. The Grand
Sheikh’s progress terminated on the Tripoli coast, where he was met
by a Turkish submarine and carried over to Constantinople. He was
received by the Sultan and has remained there ever since, an exile
from his native land, probably regretting that he ever allowed
himself to be persuaded to throw in his lot with the Turks.</p>

<p>Sayed Ahmed did not distinguish himself in this campaign.
Whenever he thought that the fighting was too near he hurriedly
retired to some more distant place. His cowardly conduct was to
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> certain extent
responsible for the failure of his troops; he never took part in
the fighting and never led them in person. His behaviour was very
different to that of Ali Dinar, Sultan of Darfur, in the Sudan, who
was also persuaded by the Turks to rebel against the English at the
same time. The latter showed considerable personal courage, and was
killed on the field at the end of the war. Sayed Ahmed was
succeeded by his cousin, Sidi Mohammed Idris, the son of Mohammed
el Madhi, who had always shown himself to be strongly pro-British,
and had carefully refrained from taking any part in the Senussi
rising and the subsequent campaign. An agreement was drawn up by
the British and the Italians which arranged that Idris should be
responsible for keeping order inland, and that he should receive
money and assistance. This arrangement has been in force up to now,
and is in every way a success.</p>

<p class="dcap">SIWA town is like no other place that I have seen
either in Egypt, Palestine or the Sudan. It is built on a great
rock in the centre of the oasis, and from a distance it resembles
an ancient castle whose rugged battlements tower above the forests
of waving palm trees, and the rich green cultivation. It is
somewhat similar to St. Michael’s Mount, but the inside of the town
reminds one more of those enormous ant hills which are found in
Central Africa. The houses are built of mud, mixed with salt, with
occasional large blocks of stone from the temples let into the
walls. The builder works without a line, gradually adding to the
wall, sitting astride the part which he has completed, so few of
the walls are straight. Another architectural peculiarity is that
owing to the necessity of constructing walls thicker at the base
than at the top most of the houses, especially the minarets of the
mosques, become narrower towards the summit. The houses are built
one above the other against the face of the rock, and the outer
walls form one great<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_134">[134]</span> line of battlements, pierced by little
groups of windows, encircling the town, and rising sheer above the
ground, in some places to a height of almost 200 feet. The original
site of the town was the summit and sides of two limestone rocks
which rise abruptly from the level of the plain; but as the
population increased more houses were built on the top of the old
ones, and the town, instead of spreading, began to ascend into the
air, house upon house, street upon street, and quarter upon
quarter, till it became more like a bee-hive than a town. Fathers
built houses for their sons above the parental abode, till their
great-grandsons reached a dizzy height on the topmost battlements.
The mud of which the walls were built gradually hardened and became
almost of the consistency of the original rock.</p>

<p>In course of time the inside of the town has become a vast
warren of houses connected by steep, twisting tunnels, very similar
to the workings in a coal mine, where one needs to carry a light
even in daytime, and two persons can scarcely walk abreast. This
labyrinthine maze of dark, narrow passages, with little low doors
of split palm logs opening into them from the tenements above,
forms the old town of Siwa. In some places the walls are partly
ruined and one gets little views of the green oasis, or the lower
part of the town with its flat roofs and square enclosures, framed
by the jagged ruined masonry. It took me nearly two years to know
my way about this part of the town, at the expense of
hitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> my head
many times against the palm log beams supporting the low roofs
which are in most cases only about 5 feet high.</p>

<p>This human warren is surprisingly clean and free from the smells
that one would expect in a place where there is such an absence of
light and ventilation. One of the most curious things that one
notices is the subdued hum of human voices, from invisible people,
and the perpetual sound of stone-grinding mills, above, below and
all around. When one meets people, groping along these tortuous
passages, they loom into sight, silently, white robed, like ghosts,
and pass with a murmured greeting to their gloomy homes. It is a
great relief after stooping and slipping and barking one’s shins to
reach the open roof on the highest tower of the town where, for a
moment, the brilliant sunlight dazzles one’s eyes, accustomed to
the murky gloom of the lower regions. When, on rare occasions, I
had visitors, I used always to take them up to see the view from
the highest battlements, with a few stout Sudanese Camel Corps men
to help pull, push and propel the sightseers. But most of them,
especially the elderly colonel type, were too hot and exhausted to
appreciate the view when they finally arrived, so I eventually kept
this “sight” for only the most active visitors.</p>

<p>High up in the heart of the town, in a little open space
surrounded by tall grim houses, there is an ancient well cut out of
the solid rock. It contains excellent water. Apparently there is a
spring in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
centre of the rock which supplies the well, and two smaller ones
close by. Half-way down the well, about 30 feet from the top, just
above the level of the water, there is a small entrance, wide
enough to admit a boy, which leads into a narrow tunnel bored
through the rock, terminating in the precincts of a mosque on the
level ground. Nobody has traversed this passage for many years,
owing to fear of snakes—which certainly exist, also jinns and
afreets. The tunnel is about 150 yards long, and must have taken
years to complete, but it is difficult to guess its original
object. This old well is specially popular with women, as by
drawing water here they can avoid going out to the springs where
they would necessarily meet with men. Often when I passed out from
the narrow entrance of a passage I would see a dozen women busy
with their pitchers, veils cast aside, laughing and chattering—in a
moment, like magic, every one would have silently vanished, and
only the eyes peering from the adjoining windows would show any
signs of life.</p>

<p>Below the old high town, huddled at the base of the mighty
walls, there are more houses, and these, too, are surrounded by an
outer wall. Beyond this more modern houses have been built when
there was less fear of raids from hostile Arabs. Most of the
sheikhs and the rich merchants have deserted the high town and
built large, comfortable houses down below, or among the gardens in
the adjoining suburbs of Sebukh and Manshia. Many of them have also
country houses, where they retire in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_137">[137]</span> summer when the heat in the town becomes
intolerable, on their estates in different parts of the oasis.
Residences of sheikhs and notables are distinguished by a strip of
whitewash across the front, but woe betide a poor man if he
decorates his house in a like manner. Tombs of sheikhs and holy men
are whitewashed all over every year, at public expense. One of the
most wealthy, and most unpopular, merchants covered the whole of
his house with whitewash. This innovation caused grave disapproval
among the conservative sheikhs of Siwa. They complained to me,
saying that from time immemorial the notables had distinguished
their houses by the strip of whitewash, but nobody had ever
whitened the whole house—therefore nobody should! When a few days
later some thieves broke into the “whitewashed sepulchre” and stole
twelve pounds, the whole population agreed that it was a just
retribution on unseemly pride.</p>

<p>The three date markets are large walled-in squares where every
merchant and family have a space to spread their dates for sale;
one of them is common, the other two belong to east and west
respectively. There is a little house by the entrance of each
market where an old Sudanese watchman lives, paid in kind by
contributions from everybody who uses the market. In the autumn
thousands of Arabs come from Egypt and the west to buy dates, which
are considered among the best in Egypt. Round the markets there are
enclosures for camels and lodgings for the Arabs, who are only
tolerated in the town<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_138">[138]</span> because they come to trade. At the height
of the season there is a busy scene. Hundreds of white-robed Arabs
wander among the heaps of red, brown and yellow dates, arguing and
bargaining loudly, while their camels gurgle and snarl outside, and
over everything there rises a swarm of flies. Half-naked negroes
toil and sweat as they load the camels with white palm-leaf baskets
pressed down and full with sticky dates. Lively diversions occur
when a shrill-voiced she-camel shakes off her load and runs wildly
through the crowd, scattering the people, with her long neck
stretched out like an agitated goose. Arab ponies squeal and
shriek, donkeys bray and the pariah dogs snarl and yelp. There is a
custom in Siwa that anybody may eat freely from the dates in the
markets, but nobody is allowed to take any away; so the beggars,
who are very numerous, crawl in among the buyers, clutching
greedily with filthy hands at the best dates, and adding their
whining complaints to the general din. Also all the dogs, children,
chickens, goats and pigeons feed from the dates before the owners
sell them. The most popular form of date food is a sort of “mush,”
which consists of a solid mass of compressed dates with most, but
not all, of the stones removed. I used to like dates, but after an
hour in the markets one never wishes to eat another.</p>

<p>The square white tomb of Sidi Suliman dominates the date
markets. Although not actually a mosque it is the most venerated
building in Siwa. Around it there are a few white tombstones, and
on most nights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span> the
building is illuminated with candles burnt by votaries at the
shrine of the saint. Close by there is a large unfinished mosque
which was built by the ex-Khedive, who left off the work owing to
lack of funds. Mosques in Siwa are conspicuous by their curious
minarets, which remind one of small factory chimneys, or brick
kilns; otherwise they are very similar to houses, except that they
generally include a large court with a roof supported by mud
pillars. In several of the mosques there are schools, and one sees
a number of small boys sitting on the ground, with bored
expressions, droning long verses of the Koran in imitation of the
old sheikh who teaches them.</p>

<p>Lately the “Powers that Be” decided that a regular school would
be beneficial to the youth of Siwa. With some difficulty I secured
a building and a teacher. The school began in great style. Almost
every boy in the town attended. They learnt reading and writing,
and after sunset they did “physical jerks” and drill, marching
round the market square, much to the admiration of their parents.
But the novelty palled. Attendance diminished. Attendance at school
was to be quite voluntary, so I could do nothing. In about a month
it had ceased to exist, and the little boys sat again at the feet
of the old sheikhs in the mosque schools. Such is the conservatism
of Siwa.</p>

<p>Shopping in Siwa is very simple. Each shop is a general shop and
contains exactly the same as the others. Prices do not vary, so one
deals exclusively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
with one merchant; the shops are sprinkled about the town and the
customers of each are the people who live nearest. The shops
themselves are hardly noticeable. There is no display of goods,
nothing in fact to distinguish a shop. One enters a little door and
the room inside looks rather more like a storeroom than a living
room; sometimes there is a rough counter, some shelves and a
weighing machine, but measures consist mostly of little baskets
which are recognized as containing certain quantities. The sacks
and cases round the room contain flour, beans, tea, rice and sugar;
in one corner there are some rolls of calico and a bundle of
coloured handkerchiefs hung on a nail from the ceiling.</p>

<p>In the storeroom which opens out of the shop there are more
sacks, tins of oil, and perhaps a bundle of bedouin blankets. Yet
some of the Siwan merchants clear over a thousand pounds a year by
their shops and a little trade in dates. Egyptian money is used,
the silver being much preferred to the paper currency, and credit
is allowed, which enables the merchants to obtain mortgages and
eventually possession of some of their customers’ gardens.</p>

<p>The merchants’ wives attend to the lady customers. There is a
side door in every shop which leads to an upper room, and here the
Siwan ladies buy their clothes, served by the wife or mother of the
merchant. Their purchases are mainly “kohl” for darkening the eyes,
henna for ornamenting fingers and hands, silver ornaments, soft
scarlet leather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
shoes and boots, blue cotton material manufactured at Kerdassa,
near Gizeh, grey shawls, silks for embroidery, dyes for colouring
baskets and very expensive flashy silk handkerchiefs made in
Manchester, which they wear round their heads when indoors. Some of
the merchants’ wives sell charms and amulets besides clothes. The
women are very conservative in their fashions, only certain colours
being worn. I once wanted a piece of green material to use in
making a flag. I sent to every single shop in the town, but without
success. However, it caused great excitement, and I heard, on the
following day, that the gossips of the town had come to the
conclusion that I was going to marry, and the green stuff was to be
part of the lady’s trousseau. They were disappointed.</p>

<p>There is nothing in Siwa that compares with the gorgeous bazaars
of Cairo, or the gaily decked shops in the markets of provincial
towns. These dark little shops have no colour, only a queer, rather
pleasant smell, a potpourri of incense, spices, herbs, onions,
olive oil and coffee. Meat is bought direct from the butchers, who
combine and kill a sheep or a camel. Sugar and tea are the most
popular necessities on the market. During the war, and for some
time after, there was a sugar shortage. The supply for Siwa arrived
at the coast, but rarely reached the oasis. When a small quantity
did reach Siwa it was bought up immediately, and the merchants who
obtained it took to gross profiteering. The price of an oke (2½
lbs.) reached as much as 40 piastres (8s.),<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_142">[142]</span> which in Egypt is an excessively high
price. Eventually the sale of sugar was supervised by the
Government and sugar tickets were issued. Even then there were
cases of sugar being smuggled across the frontier to Tripoli, where
the shortage was even more severe. Arabs or Siwans are simply
miserable if they have to go without sugar in their tea. It makes
them cross and tiresome, and they say themselves that it injures
their health. For the rest people depend on their garden produce,
on dates, onions, fruit and coarse native bread. The women make
their own clothes, and generally their husbands’ too, sometimes
weaving the wool for the long “jibbas,” worn by the working men, on
rough handlooms. There is a carpenter in the town and several
masons, but as a shopping “centre” Siwa is not much of a catch.</p>

<p>Although Siwan houses are unprepossessing from the outside their
interiors are comparatively comfortable. What I personally objected
to was the exceeding lowness of the doors, and yet the Siwans on
the whole are tall. They told me that doors were made small for the
sake of warmth. Roughly the houses are built on the usual Arab
pattern; on the ground floor there are storerooms, stables, and
servants’ quarters, upstairs there are guest-rooms, harem, and
living rooms. The entrance hall has seats of mud similar to the
walls, and is usually screened from sight by a corner inside the
door. Stairs are steep and narrow with sudden sharp turnings; they
are always pitch dark, as only the rooms in the outer<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> walls receive any light. Each
house consists of two or three storeys and above them there is an
open roof, sometimes with several rooms built on to it. The old
houses of the high town are different, only those on the topmost
level have open roofs. The immense thickness of the walls makes the
houses cool in summer when the temperature often reaches 112
degrees in the shade, and warm in winter when icy winds sweep down
from the high desert plateau. The rooms in the houses of the better
classes are large and high, lit by little square windows, which are
made in groups of three, one above and two below in order not to
put unnecessary strain on the masonry. Each window has four
divisions with a shutter to each division; these shutters are kept
open in summer-time. The windows are very low, a few feet above the
level of the floor, which allows people sitting on the ground to
see out of them. The ceilings are made of palm trunks covered with
rushes and a layer of mud; the ends of the trunks, if they are too
long, project outside the walls and serve as pegs on which to hang
bundles of bones to avert the “Evil Eye.” Mud, which becomes as
hard as cement, is used not only for the walls, but for the stairs,
the divans, ovens, and most of the kitchen utensils. Old stone
coffins, discovered near the temple or in some of the rock tombs,
are utilized as water-troughs in most houses. The floors are
covered with palm matting, and an occasional old Turkish or Persian
carpet; the divans are furnished with a few cushions, white
bolster-like objects, or beautifully stamped<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_144">[144]</span> leather from the Sudan. The walls are
whitewashed and sometimes ornamented with crude coloured frescoes,
and in almost every room there are several heavy wooden chests,
handsomely carved, sometimes of great age, which are used for
keeping valuables. Occasionally one sees a couple of chairs and a
round tin table, like those which are used outside cafes, but
personally I have always felt much more comfortable sitting
cross-legged on a heap of cushions near the window than perched up
on a rickety chair above my hosts. A brass tray, a low round table,
a few baskets and an earthenware lamp hanging on the wall,
completes the furniture of a guest-room. I have spent many pleasant
hours sitting in one of these high rooms looking out over the
feathery palm trees and watching the colours change as the sun sank
behind the mountains, gossiping to some old sheikh, puffing a
cigarette, and drinking little cups of sweet, green tea.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw2">
<figure id="i14"><img src='images/i14.jpg' alt=''>
<p class="cp1">THE WESTERN QUARTER FROM AN EASTERN ROOF</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>In summer-time the people sleep on the flat roofs of their
houses, which for that reason are surrounded by low mud walls to
ensure privacy from the neighbours. They lie on the roofs, men,
women and children, always with their faces covered from the moon,
because they say moonlight on sleeping faces causes madness. In the
daytime the women gossip on the housetops and carry on intrigues,
for there is nothing easier than hopping over the walls from one
roof to the other, and it is not considered <em>comme il faut</em>
for husbands to frequent the roofs in daytime. Often when I climbed
up to the citadel and looked<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_145">[145]</span> down over the town I saw a group of girls
sitting on the roofs, generally singing and dressing each other’s
hair. When they caught sight of an intruder watching them from
above they bolted down the steep stairs like rabbits to their
burrows. One sees real rabbits, too. Almost all the natives breed
them, and for safety’s sake they are kept on the housetops.</p>

<p>One of the features of Siwa town are the “Dululas,” or sun
shelters. They consist of spaces shaded from the sun by a roof of
rushes and mud, supported by mud pillars. Often in the centre there
is a stone basin containing water, which is kept always full at the
expense of one of the sheikhs in memory of a deceased relation.
Here the greybeards of the town assemble in the evenings, strangers
sit and gossip when they visit the town, and the Camel Corps men
wander through to hear the latest news. It is a sort of public
club, and one hears even more gossip than at a club at home. The
largest of these sun shelters has become a little market, and a few
decrepit old men spread out their wares in its shade—a few baskets,
a dozen onions, an old silk, tattered waistcoat and some red pepper
would be the stock-in-trade of one of these hawkers. What they say
in the “suk” corresponds to the “bazaar talk” in India, and it is
incredible how soon the most secret facts are known there.</p>

<p>The Siwans are a distinct race quite apart from the Arabs of the
Western Desert, but in appearance they differ very slightly from
their bedouin neighbours. Owing to their isolated dwelling-place
they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> retained
their original language, which appears to be an aboriginal Berber
dialect. They are unquestionably the remnants of an aboriginal
people of Berber stock, but constant intermarriage with outsiders
has obliterated any universal feature in their appearance, and
through intermarriage with Sudanese they have acquired a darker
complexion and in some few cases negroid features. On the whole one
does not see the Arab type, or the Fellah, or the Coptic type among
the Siwans.</p>

<p>The men are tall and powerfully built, with slightly fairer
complexions than the Arabs. In some cases they have light straight
hair and blue eyes, and one whole family has red hair and pink
cheeks, though they themselves do not know where this originated.
Most of the younger men are singularly ugly and have a fierce and
bestial expression, but with age they improve, and the elders of
the town are pleasant, dignified-looking men, though effeminate in
their manners. The children are pallid and unhealthy in appearance.
The Siwans have high cheek-bones, straight noses, and short, weak
chins. They are very conceited and think much of their looks; on
feast days even the oldest men darken their eyes with “kohl” and
soak themselves with evil-smelling scent.</p>

<p>The wealthy Siwans wear the usual Arab dress—white robes, a long
silk shawl twisted round the body and flung over one shoulder, a
soft red, blue-tasselled cap and yellow leather shoes. On gala days
they appear in brilliant silks from Cairo, and coloured<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span> robes from Tripoli and
Morocco, but on ordinary occasions the predominating colour is
white. The servants and labourers, who form the bulk of the
population, and include many Sudanese who were brought from the
south as slaves, wear a long white shirt, white drawers, a skull
cap and sometimes a curious sack-like garment made of locally spun
wool ornamented by brightly coloured patterns in silk or dye. Siwa
is the only place in Egypt where one does not see the natives
apeing European dress or slouching about in khaki trousers or
tunics—remnants of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p>The women are small and slender, and very pale owing to the
inactivity of strict seclusion. The palest women are the most
admired. Their large black eyes are ornamented with “kohl,” and
their small hands are tinted with henna. In public they wear a
universal dress which is quite distinctive. It consists of a dark
blue striped robe, reaching below the knees, with full sleeves, cut
square and embroidered round the neck, white drawers with a strip
of embroidery round the ankles, and a large square grey shawl with
a dark blue border, which covers them when they go abroad. Their
ornaments consist of innumerable silver ear-rings, with bunches of
silver chains and little bells, silver bangles, anklets, and
necklaces. An unmarried girl is distinguished by a “virginity
disc,” which is an engraved silver disc about the size of a saucer,
suspended round the neck by a heavy silver ring. These rings are
generally very old and beautifully engraved with<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> arabesques. When a Siwan woman
is wearing all her silver ornaments she tinkles like a tinsmith’s
cart, but her husband poetically compares her to a caparisoned
pony. Their general appearance is quite pleasing, but they are very
unlike the handsome, healthy-looking Arab women of the coast.</p>

<p>At home the wealthier women wear coloured silks and richer
clothes. They wear their straight black hair thickly oiled and
dressed in a complicated coiffure. A fringe of short curls hangs
above the eyes, and a number of plaited braids are worn on each
side of the face, like the fringe of a mop. Strips of scarlet
leather are twisted into the tresses, which must always be of an
uneven number, and on the ends of the leather are hung silver
bells, rings and amulets. One of the first travellers to Siwa
remarked on the strength of an ear that could bear such heavy
silver ear-rings, but instead of hanging from the actual ear the
rings are fastened to a leather band across the top of the head.
All the material for women’s clothes is made by one family of
Egyptian merchants at Kerdassa, near the Pyramids. One brother has
a shop in Siwa, and the others live in Egypt. Owing to this the
price of clothing is very great, yet none of the Siwan merchants
have ever considered setting up an opposition trade.</p>

<p>Women of the upper classes rarely appear in public during the
day, except at funerals, when hundreds of them squat round the
house, like a crowd of grey crows, howling and shrieking. When one
rides past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> they hop
up from the ground and run a few steps, with long grey shawls
trailing behind them on the ground, and then they squat down again,
like vultures scared off a carcase. They never work in the fields
or drive the flocks to pasturage like the Arab women, or the
fellahin, but occupy themselves in making baskets, or pottery, and
in household duties. When one woman calls on another she wears all
the clothes she possesses, and gradually discards them in order to
impress the people she is visiting with her wealth. When I met a
woman in the streets she would scuttle into the nearest doorway, or
if there was not one handy she would pull a shawl over her face and
flatten herself against a wall; even hideous old harridans affected
an ecstasy of shyness on seeing an Englishman. Hardly any of the
women can speak Arabic, and it is owing to their strange secretive
lives that the Siwans have retained their language and are so
unprogressive to-day. They resolutely oppose all innovations,
refusing even the help and advice of the Egyptian Government
doctor. It is to their influence as mothers that the women owe what
power they have, because Siwan men care very little for their
wives. Most men keep one wife only at a time, but they often marry
as many as twenty or thirty, if they can afford to, divorcing each
one when she ceases to please.</p>

<p>The Siwans are typically Oriental. They are hospitable,
dishonest, lazy, picturesque, ignorant, superstitious, cheerful,
cunning, easily moved to joy or anger, fond of intrigue and ultra
conservative. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
are not immoral, they simply have no morals. The men are
notoriously degenerate and resemble in their habits the Pathans of
India. They seem to consider that every vice and indulgence is
lawful. It is strange that these people who are among the most
fanatical Mohammedans of Africa should have become the most
vicious. Yet most of the Siwans are Senussi, members of that
Mohammedan sect which corresponds in a way to the Puritanism of
Christianity. It advocates a simple and abstemious life, and
condemns severely smoking, drinking and luxury. Yet the most
religious sheikhs are generally the most flagrantly outrageous.</p>

<p>In spite of their unenviable reputation the Siwans are quite
satisfied with themselves, and speak with tolerant pity of the
Arabs and the Sudanese. The Siwan Sudanese have become like their
original masters, and do not seem to object to being called
“slaves,” but there are constantly furious rows between the natives
and the Camel Corps originating with the word “slave” being used
with reference to the latter. The Arabs, and to a greater extent
the Siwans, consider themselves very superior to the Sudanese who,
until quite recently, they could buy and sell.</p>

<p>The population is divided into two classes, the one consisting
of the sheikhs, merchants and landowners, the other of the servants
and labourers. The former class is an all-powerful minority. There
is no middle class. There is also a religious division; the Senussi
predominate in numbers, but<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_151">[151]</span> the Medinia sect is the richest. The latter
sect is said to be the successor of the Wahhabi confraternity; it
is connected with the Dirkawi, which was founded by Sheikh Arabi el
Dirkawi. It was established about one hundred years ago by Sheikh
Zafer el Medani, who was born at Medina in Arabia. His doctrines
found favour in Tripoli and were adopted by the Siwans some time
before the arrival of the Senussi, and Sheikh Zafer himself visited
Siwa on several occasions. The two sects are very similar. The
Medinia have still several religious centres in Egypt and Tripoli,
but they lost ground considerably on the advent of Senussiism. In
spite of their similarities the two sects are by no means well
disposed to each other. Membership is hereditary, and no one has
been known to change from one party to the other. They have their
own mosques, sheikhs and funds, and on religious festivals they
hold their meetings in different parts of the town. I used always
to make a point of visiting the gatherings of each sect. There are
two other less important religious bodies known as the “Arusia” and
the “Sudania,” but they only consist of a few dozen old men who
perform strange dances on festivals in honour of their particular
saints. The Siwans are very religious, more so than the average
Arab, but this is probably owing to the fact that their mosques are
conveniently near, and if one is absent from mosque the neighbours
notice, and talk about it! One has heard of such things at
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>The prosperity
of the people depends almost entirely on the date harvest. The date
groves, which form the wealth of the oasis, are watered by some two
hundred fresh-water springs. The water rises through natural
fissures, or artificial bore-holes, from a sandstone bed about 400
feet below the surface. The largest springs, such as the “Fountain
of the Sun,” measure as much as 50 yards in diameter, with a depth
of about 40 feet. Each basin is fed by a group of little
water-holes, and the water comes up from the ground sometimes in
continuous streams of bubbles, and sometimes with sudden bursts, so
the surface seems constantly moving. There is a theory that an
underground river flows east towards the Nile and its water comes
to the surface in the various oases between Egypt and Tripoli. The
fact that Siwa lies considerably below the level of the desert
plateau, and even below sea-level, supports this theory. Or
possibly the water comes from the high desert plateau north of
Siwa, where there is a heavy rainfall; but the water supply never
varies, and has never been known to run dry. The water in the
springs differs considerably. In some it is very brackish, in
others it is quite sweet, and some springs are flavoured with
sulphur; again, some springs are warm, and others are several
degrees colder, so one can chose a bathing-place, hot or cold,
according to inclination. Many springs, often the sweetest ones,
rise a few feet away from the salt marshes, and one spring, which
used to be salt, has now become sweet. The largest springs are
edged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> to a certain
depth with squared stones and blocks of masonry, which looks as if
it might have been finished yesterday, though it was probably built
almost a thousand years ago. The basins are generally round, shaded
by a ring of palm trees, beyond which lie the gardens.</p>

<p>The sides of the basins have been gradually built higher and
higher, so that the surface of the water is now several feet above
the level ground, and little brooks run down from the spring heads
into the gardens in all directions. They are regulated by rough
sluice gates, made generally of a large flat stone, which is
removed to allow the water to flow, and replaced, with a plaster of
mud, when the water is no longer needed. Each spring forms the
nucleus of a garden which belongs to a number of different people.
The gardens are divided into little beds of a uniform size, about 8
feet square, lying an inch or two lower than the level of the
ground. These beds are known as “hods.” When the water is flowing
the labourer goes in turn to each “hod” and scoops a passage with
his hands connecting the “hod” with the water channel, which is on
a higher level, then he makes a rough dam across the channel so
that the water flows into the “hod” and fills it; afterwards he
closes the entrance of the “hod” with a handful of mud, pushes
aside the mud dam, and the stream flows on to the next “hod,” where
the same thing occurs. I have seen little boys at the seaside doing
just the same sort of thing. In<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_154">[154]</span> some cases two water channels cross, and
then one of them flows through a hollowed palm trunk.</p>

<p>The cultivation round every spring is made up of a number of
gardens owned by different men, some of them consisting of no more
than half a dozen palm trees and a couple of “hods.” All the ground
is watered by the central spring, so a careful water system has
been evolved by which the water is divided and portioned out to
each piece of garden. For each spring there is a ponderous tome
called “Daftar el Ain”—the Book of the Spring, which records the
exact quantity of water, or rather the time of water, that each
garden is allowed. This is followed with the greatest care by the
Keeper of the Spring, who regulates the irrigation, and is paid by
the owners of the adjoining garden in proportion to the number of
trees that they own. Each day is divided into two halves, from
sunrise to sunset, and sunset to sunrise; this again is subdivided
into eighths, and each subdivision is called a “wagabah.” Thus if
Osman Daud’s garden receives an allowance of four “wagabah” every
other day, it means that he receives the full strength of the water
from the springs for twelve hours on consecutive days.</p>

<p>When one buys a garden the water rights are included, but men
often sell part of their water right to a neighbour, this, of
course, being recorded in the Book of the Spring, which is kept by
one of the sheikhs. The “Ghaffir el Ain,” or Guardian of the
Spring, takes his time from the call of the muezzin, or in distant
gardens by the sun and the stars. At<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_155">[155]</span> night a special muezzin calls from one of
the mosques for the benefit of the watchmen on the springs out in
the gardens. The system has been in force for so many centuries
that there are very rarely any disputes on the subject. All
questions are referred to the books, which serve also as records of
ownership of the gardens.</p>

<p>Each Siwan, however poor, keeps a book of his own in which he
enters, or rather pays a scribe to record, an account of his
property. It states the boundaries, number of trees and water
rights of his garden. When a man buys a garden he writes down the
particulars in his “daftar,” and this is signed by the person who
sold the garden, and witnessed by several responsible sheikhs or
“nas tayebin”—respectable people. This entry serves as a title-deed
for the purchase. When I was at Siwa there was a lengthy and
involved law case about the ownership of some property, in which
one party, in order to prove inheritance, forged an entry in his
“daftar.” But cases of forgery were not frequent—fortunately, as
they added considerable complications to an already difficult
case.</p>

<p>There is more water in Siwa than is required for irrigating the
gardens, and in many cases sweet water flows to waste among the
salt marshes. The Siwans are unenterprising. They only cultivate
just sufficient for their own needs, and not always that: they only
work in the gardens where the soil, after centuries of watering and
manuring, has become very rich. They grow a very little wheat and
barley, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> not
enough to supply the population, who depend on imported barley from
the coast, yet there are many fertile plots of land which would
raise corn, and which could easily be irrigated. Lack of labour and
implements is their excuse when one questions them, but in the
spring numbers of Siwans go up to the coast and hire themselves out
to the bedouins as labourers, preferring to work on the coast
instead of increasing the cultivation in their oasis.</p>

<p>The palm groves of Siwa are very beautiful. It seems a veritable
Garden of Hesperides when one arrives there after a long trek on
the waterless desert which surrounds the oasis. One appreciates the
slumberous shade of the luxuriant gardens, long, lazy bathes in the
deep cool springs, and feasts of fruit on the banks of little
rushing streams. Perhaps it is not surprising that the Siwans are
lazy and indolent, for their country is in many ways a land of
Lotus Eaters. The natives have a happy-go-lucky Omar Khayyámish
outlook on life which is accentuated by the place they inhabit.</p>

<p>The gardens consist mainly of date groves with some olive
orchards. But among the date palms there are many other trees—figs,
pomegranates, pears, peaches, plums, apricots, apples, prickly
pears, limes and sweet lemons. The numerous vineyards produce
quantities of exceptionally fine grapes, which last for several
months and are so plentiful that large quantities rot on the
branches. The natives are not very fond of them and no wine is made
in Siwa, except “araki,” which is distilled from ripe
dates.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> Dates and a
little olive oil are the only exports, and it is on the produce of
the date palms that the life of the people depends. The poorer
Siwans live almost entirely on dates; the beams and the doors of
the houses are made from palm trunks; mats, baskets and fences are
made from palm fronds; saddle crossbars are made from the wood;
saddle packing consists of the thick fibre, the branches are used
for fuel; the young white heart of the budding leaves is eaten as a
special delicacy, and the sap of the palm makes “lubki,” a drink
which is much liked by natives. The wealth of the whole community
is derived from the sale of dates, so it is not surprising that
they watch anxiously in springtime to see if the crop will be a
good one. Generally, on alternate years, there is a good crop, then
a fair crop, and when dates are plentiful olives are few. Nature
seems to have made this careful arrangement.</p>

<p>The cultivation of dates is by no means as simple as it would
appear. The trees need careful watering, manuring and trimming, and
one notices very clearly the difference in crops from well or badly
cared for gardens. In the early spring the work of artificial
pollination is carried out by special men who are skilled in the
process. A branch is cut from the male date tree, which bears no
fruit, sharpened, and thrust into the trunk of the female tree.
Unless this is done to every tree the fruit becomes small and
worthless. There are about 170,000 trees, each of which bears,
after the fifth year, an average of three hundred pounds of fruit.
Little attention is paid to the other<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_158">[158]</span> fruits which deteriorate from lack of
pruning, but with a little trouble and proper methods they would
improve. Formerly the oasis produced rice, oranges, bananas and
sugar canes, but these no longer grow as they needed more trouble
to cultivate. Only dates and olives are sold, and it is considered
very shameful for a man to sell other fruit; the same idea applies
to milk. Siwans either eat fruit themselves, give it to their
friends, or let it rot; only the very poor natives sell any. I had
considerable difficulty in getting a regular supply, but eventually
I accepted “gifts” daily from certain men, and repaid them with
sugar, which they liked, though if I had offered them money they
would have considered themselves grievously insulted.</p>

<p>While at Siwa I dried large quantities of figs and
apricots—mish-mish—which were very successful, and especially
useful for taking out on trek when fresh fruit is unobtainable.
None of the natives had attempted drying fruit, though the
excessive heat and the flat roofs offer excellent opportunities,
and quite an industry could be developed in this way. A variety of
vegetables are grown, but only by a very few people. The most
common are onions, watercress, radishes, pepper, cucumbers,
gherkins, egg fruit, mint, parsley and garlic.</p>

<p>The gardens are manured with dry leaves and dried bundles of a
thorny plant called “argoul,” which grows about the oasis and is
much liked by camels. Bundles of it are cut and left for some
months to dry, and finally dug into the soil round the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> fruit trees. The streets,
markets and stables are all swept carefully, and the manure is sold
to owners of gardens. The contents of public and private latrines
are all collected and used as manure in the gardens. It is a good
system, as it ensures sanitary arrangements being promptly carried
out. The soil of Siwa is strongly impregnated with salt. In many
places there are stretches of “sebukh” which consists of earth
hardened by a strong proportion of salt which feels, and looks,
like a ploughed field after a black frost. It is almost impassable,
and the occasional deep water-holes, hidden by a layer of thin
soil, make walking as dangerous as it is difficult. Two large salt
lakes lie one on the east and one on the west of the town. The
water in these lakes rises irregularly during the winter months,
and subsides in the summer, leaving a glistening white surface of
pure salt which looks exactly like ice, especially in places where
the dark water shows between cracks in the salt. One can lift up
white slabs of salt in the same way as ice, and send a piece
skimming across the surface, like stones on a frozen pond at home.
Sometimes there are deep pools in the midst of the marshes where
the white salt and the vivid blue sky combine to colour the water
with the most brilliant greens and blues. Causeways built by the
natives traverse the marshes, and by these alone it is possible to
cross them. In ancient days the Ammonians sent a tribute of salt to
the kings of Persia, and such was the quality of the salt that it
was used for certain special religious rites. The glitter of the
salt lakes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> the
middle of the day is intensely trying to the eyes, but at sunset
they reflect and seem to exaggerate every colour of the brilliant
sky.</p>

<p>The salt lakes, the numerous springs, and the stagnant water
lying about the gardens bred mosquitoes and fevers. Formerly this
low-lying oasis was a hotbed of typhoid and malaria. Its evil
reputation was known to the bedouins who never stayed there a day
longer than was necessary, and even now they speak of almost every
fever as “Siwan fever.” The natives themselves attributed the fever
to fruit, and still call it “mish-mish fever,” owing to its
prevalence during the season when apricots are ripe. But nowadays
conditions are enormously improved. Typhoid is practically unknown,
the malarial mosquito has been banished from Siwa, though it still
swarms in the neighbouring oases; several thousand pounds has been
spent by the Egyptian Government in draining and filling up
stagnant pools, and fish have been imported by the Ministry of
Health which breed in the springs and feed upon the mosquitoes’
eggs. The town is kept clean and there are very strict regulations
about sanitation, and thousands of sugar-coated quinine tablets are
distributed to the people each week. They have discovered now just
how much of the sugar can be licked off before the quinine begins
to taste. The result is that since the war there have been very few
new cases of malaria, though many of the people are so sodden with
fever that it is impossible to cure them.</p>

<p class="cp1">CLEANING TAMOUSY SPRING</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>It is supposed
that the fever is a form of malaria, but when I got it myself, very
badly, and had several blood tests taken in Cairo, no germ of any
known fever was found. The same thing happened to three other
Englishmen who caught the fever in Siwa. So far no careful analysis
has been made of the disease, which is spoken of as “malaria”
because it is certain that malaria exists in the oasis.</p>

<p>Each spring in Siwa is cleaned out once in every two years in
the summer-time. On these occasions the owners of the gardens give
a free meal to the labourers, and a luncheon party to their
friends. It is a popular and pleasant entertainment. Almost all the
men in the town turn out and work in relays of fifty or a hundred,
baling out the water from the springs with old kerosene tins,
leather buckets and earthenware pitchers. It is a slow proceeding;
some of the largest springs take several days to finish, and the
work must be continuous, as the basins are continually filling. The
men and boys, covered with mud, shout and sing as they work, every
now and then diving into the water and swimming round. Every man,
woman and child in Siwa can swim, and most of them are expert
divers. The women swim like dogs, with much splashing, but the men
are very good. A pump would drain a well in a single day and save
much labour and wasted time. As the water sinks masons and
carpenters repair the sides of the basin, fitting in new stones and
patching up old ones. A curious custom terminates these occasions.
Each guest and labourer is presented by the owners<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> of the spring with a handful
of berseem—clover—as a partial payment for his labour. When the men
ride home in the evening they twist the clover in wreaths round
their heads and round the donkeys’ ears, then, when they arrive at
the town, the donkeys are allowed to eat it.</p>

<p>One of the “characters” of Siwa, always very much in evidence on
these occasions, was an old, half-witted man known as “Sultan
Musa.” He suffered from a delusion that he was the Sultan of Siwa,
but I fancy that he was trifle less foolish than he pretended to
be. He played the part of court jester at all entertainments. The
Siwans found him intensely comic; they asked him questions—how old
was he, how many wives, and what he had done; when he mumbled that
he was 100 years old and had 20 wives, and various other domestic
details, they simply shrieked with laughter. I got heartily sick of
the old imbecile and announced that I did not wish to see him when
I went anywhere. Sometimes when I arrived at a party I would catch
sight of him being hurriedly bundled out of sight, and later I
heard the servants in the background laughing hilariously at his
dreary witticisms.</p>

<p>A few days after my arrival at Siwa I received an invitation to
a luncheon in the garden of one of the leading sheikhs. The
messenger announced that Sheikh Thomi would call for me at eight
o’clock on the following morning; I wondered at the hour—but
accepted the invitation. The next morning, while shaving before
breakfast, I was disturbed by a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_163">[163]</span> terrific hullabaloo. My dogs, who strongly
object to unknown natives, a trait which I encouraged, were
circling furiously round a party of Siwans who sat on their donkeys
below the house. My servants went out and rescued them, explaining
that I would be down soon; a few minutes later I joined them. After
many salutations and polite inquiries I was introduced to the other
guests, a crafty-looking, one-eyed merchant, two venerable,
white-bearded sheikhs and several notables of the town. They were
all dressed very distinctly in their best, wearing coloured silks
or spotless white robes. Sheikh Thomi, a cheerful, rotund little
man, with the reputation of being the richest sheikh in Siwa, wore
a long white burnous and a gorgeously embroidered scarlet silk
scarf, and rode a big black donkey with a satanic expression. I was
offered the choice of a number of donkeys. I picked out the largest
one, and off we went. The donkeys have no bridles or reins; one
steers them by beating their necks with a stick, and very
occasionally they go the way one wants them to. Mine was the
fastest, so I led the cavalcade, hoping that my mount was
sure-footed. We dashed through the town with a tremendous clatter
and a cloud of dust, scattering children, hens and old women, out
on to the roads, and then for a mile or so at a hard gallop towards
some gardens. My donkey knew the way. We arrived at the garden as
it was beginning to grow hot, and were met at the entrance by a
troop of servants who took the donkeys.</p>

<p>Sheikh Thomi led me, slightly dishevelled, through<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> a thick palm grove, followed
by the rest of the party, to a large summer-house built of logs and
thatch, set on the edge of a round spring from whose green-blue
depths constant streams of silver bubbles rose to the surface.
Little green frogs swam in the water and numbers of scarlet
dragon-flies hovered over it. The walls of the summer-house were
hung with gaily striped Tripoli blankets—vermilion, white and
green—the floor was covered with beautiful old Persian carpets, and
cushions were ranged round the sides. Through the open ends of the
building I saw long vistas of palm trunks, and the sun caught the
scarlet blossoms of the pomegranates and the shining, purple grapes
on their trellis frames. The air was heavy with the scent of orange
blossom and “tamar-el-hindi,” and the deep shade inside the hut was
a welcome relief. Outside the white-robed servants hurried to and
fro, carrying baskets and dishes, while two boys, in the distance,
sang curious Siwan songs, answering each other back as they swung
to and fro high up on two palm trees. Sheikh Thomi, with much
whispering and smiling, went outside. I leant back on my cushions
lulled by “the liquid lapse of murmuring streams,” thinking how
absolutely Eastern the whole scene was.</p>

<p>Suddenly—to my horror—I heard a hideous grinding sound and a
shrill, raucous voice with a pronounced American accent began
singing, “Waiting for the Robert E. Lee,” a tune which I always
object to. It was a gramophone, very old and decrepit, the most
prized possession of Sheikh Thomi. I tried to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_165">[165]</span> look as if I enjoyed the tune, which was
played over and over again for about half an hour, and followed by
some slightly less repulsive records of native music.</p>

<p>After listening to this musical interlude a servant brought in a
bunch of pink and white sweetly scented China roses which were
distributed among the guests, and then the meal began. A dozen boys
served as waiters, carrying the dishes from an open-air fire round
the corner where several cooks presided over the food. At first it
was suggested that I should eat alone, in solitary state, but I
protested, so Sheikh Thomi and three others ate with me, while the
rest of the guests retired outside to eat later, probably with more
ease in my absence. We sat cross-legged on the ground, a position
that without considerable practice causes the most agonising “pins
and needles.” The meal was eaten almost in silence, broken only by
the noisy sounds of eating.</p>

<p>A round wooden table was placed in the centre, and each guest
was provided with several flat round wheaten loaves, which served
as plates, and some strips of thin native bread, which looks rather
like pancake, only darker and more solid. The meal consisted mostly
of mutton, cooked in various ways—boiled, fried and stewed—with
different kinds of vegetables, salads, spices, curries and
flavourings. One of the dishes, a very excellent one, was stewed
doves, eaten with fresh grapes. The pudding was the least
appetising dish on the menu, it was made<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_166">[166]</span> of crumbled bread, mixed into a sticky mass
with “semna” oil and sugar. There were about a dozen courses. Each
one was brought in in a big dish of polished ebony and placed on
the table. The guests ate from the central dish, using the thin
bread to pick up the meat. One takes a piece of thin bread between
finger and thumb, dips into the dish, sandwiching the meat in the
bread. It sounds a messy proceeding, but after a little practice I
found it quite simple. Servants brought round a brass ewer, and
each guest washed his hands after every course; the Siwans also
rinsed their mouths—noisily. Every now and then some one would fish
out an extra succulent morsel and hand it to me, or if one man had
secured a tasty bone he would tear off the meat and heap it on to
my loaf. Towards the end of the meal a few loud hiccoughs are not
considered amiss, and to loosen one’s belt, very obviously, is
thought most complimentary. One needs it too!</p>

<p>The food was very good, excellently cooked, and so tender that
there was no difficulty in separating the meat from the bones. When
I thought, and felt, that we had finished, there followed an
enormous dish heaped high with perfectly plain boiled rice. This is
called “Shawish”—The Sergeant—because it clears away the other
dishes! Afterwards an enormous copper tray was carried in by two
boys loaded with every kind of fruit—plums, peaches, pears, grapes,
apricots and figs. Last of all came tea, and bowls of palm wine for
those who liked it. It is made from the sap of the date palm, and
when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> freshly drawn
it tastes like sweet ginger-beer, but a little goes a very long
way.</p>

<p>Tea-drinking in Siwa is as solemn a ceremony as after-dinner
port at home. The host either dispenses it himself, or as a
compliment invites one of the guests to pour out. Towards the end
of my time at Siwa I was thought to have acquired sufficient
experience, and occasionally I poured out myself. The guest
invariably pretends to refuse, protests that he is not worthy, but
eventually accepts the honour. The pourer-out is called the
“Sultan” of the party, and every “Sultan” tries to make the best
tea in the town. People are very critical, and opinions vary as to
who is the super Sultan in Siwa. As soon as the “Sultan” takes over
the job he becomes, for the time, master of the house. He calls
loudly for more sugar, boiling water, and scolds the servants as if
they were his own. If he doesn’t like the quality of the tea, he
says so and the host apologises. A servant brings a low table with
a number of little glasses about 4 inches high, a locked chest
containing three divisions for red and green tea, and sugar, and a
bowl of hot water to rinse the cups. One is asked which kind of tea
is preferred, red or green, and the safest and most popular reply
is “A mixture of both.” The “Sultan” then very deliberately rinses
the glasses from a kettle of boiling water which stands on a little
brazier at his side, measures out the tea into the pot, adds a
little water, pours it away, then carefully makes the tea, pours
out a little, tastes it, and finally, if he approves of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> the flavour, hands one
glassful to each guest. The tea is drunk with no milk; the first
brew is rather bitter, with a very little sugar, the second is very
sweet, and the third, and best, is flavoured with rose petals,
orange blossom, or fresh mint. Each guest drinks one glass only of
each brew, and what is over is poured out and sent to the servants,
or into the harem. It should be sipped noisily, and satisfaction
expressed in the sound of drinking. One drinks either three
glasses, six, or nine. I have known twelve, but that is considered
rather an excess in polite society. Personally I consider it one of
the best drinks I know, but at first people dislike it.</p>

<p>The Siwans are greedy, when they get the chance, and on these
occasions their appetites are enormous. They have the greatest
admiration for anyone who eats copiously. A certain Government
official, whose fondness for large meals was famous, came down to
Siwa. He attended a luncheon party, which was given in his honour
by some of the sheikhs. The meal was a matter of some dozen or
fifteen courses. I myself, by using the greatest discretion, and
only eating a few mouthfuls of each dish, managed to last out. But
the guest of the day took, and ate, a liberal helping of each
course. The Siwans themselves became a trifle languid towards the
end of the meal, but he persevered. Even the plain boiled rice did
not daunt him, or the sticky oily pudding. It earned him an
everlasting admiration in Siwa, and his name is always mentioned
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> Siwan parties as
a really fine fellow, “The Englishman who ate of everything.”</p>

<p>Meat is difficult to get in the oasis. When a bedouin convoy
arrives the Arabs often slaughter and sell a camel. There are a few
sheep and goats imported from the coast, but the price of meat
makes it impossible for the poorer folk to buy it. I had with me a
number of dogs. One of them, an attractive mongrel, produced a
litter of pups. Several people asked me to give them one, and I did
so. I was pleased to see how well their new owners looked after
them; they appeared even fatter and fitter than when I had them.
Then I went into Cairo on local leave. When I returned, about a
month or so later, I inquired after the puppies. One of the men who
had taken one told me, “They were fine, so fat and so large——” But
“Where are they now?” I asked. He looked surprised, pointed to his
stomach, which was a very obvious one, and explained that they had
all been eaten last month on the “Eid el Kebir,” one of the
Mohammedan festivals. He said that nobody could ever imagine that I
had given them away for any other reason than for eating. There was
nothing to be done, but I never gave away another puppy. I drowned
the next litter, and it was considered extremely wasteful.</p>

<p>The Siwans eat cats too, and mice and rats. At one time there
were many cats in Siwa and no rats. Now there are rats but no cats.
Cats were easier to catch than rats, so they went first. One man, a
merchant, complained that his house and shop<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_170">[170]</span> was overrun with mice and rats. He had
gone to great trouble and brought a cat from Egypt, but as soon as
it was full grown it disappeared! Dogs are considered “unclean” by
the Mohammedan religion, and they are never eaten in any other
places in Egypt.</p>

<p>Dogs are useful at Siwa both as watch-dogs and companions. My
dogs used to sleep on the high terrace of the house, and they
always gave one warning of anybody coming over the half mile of
sand from the town. Besides, dogs are the most human and
affectionate of all animals, and one gets to feel the need of
companionship at Siwa. It is a solitary life. One either likes it
or hates it; there is no compromise, and most men hate it.
Sometimes one does not see a single white man for several months,
and then, when a car patrol arrives, they stay a few hours in the
town and dash back on the same day. One needs a certain temperament
to stand living at Siwa. In the summer the heat is so great that
one does not go out much in the middle of the day, unless there is
urgent necessity, consequently for many hours every day there is
nothing to do. If one sleeps much in the daytime one is unable to
sleep at night. A man at Siwa must have some form of hobby in which
he can interest himself without needing the assistance of other
people. Painting, writing, photography and reading all serve the
purpose. I mention them as they formed my own spare-time
occupations. But without something of this kind life becomes
unbearable. It is an ideal place<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_171">[171]</span> for painting and photography. The strangely
varied scenery, the brilliant sunshine, the picturesque natives,
and the wonderful colouring, especially the sunsets, provide a
variety of subjects on every side. Siwan men quite enjoy being
photographed, but the women strongly dislike it. Eventually by
teaching my Sudanese servant to use a camera I managed to secure a
few indifferent photos of women. When one “snaps” people they
immediately demand a copy of the photo, imagining that the camera
is also a simultaneous printer and developer.</p>

<p>According to the proverb “Two is company, three is none,” but I
think most men who have experienced it would agree that in an
isolated district three is generally company and two is purgatory.
The odds are one in a thousand that “the other man” will be
congenial, and if he is not life is insufferable. If there is a
third man things feel better, but to live for months on end with
one other man, who one does not really like, results in mutual
detestation. This may sound morbid and unnatural, but one sees so
many examples. I knew two quite ordinary normal men posted in a
lonely district where they rarely saw another Englishman. For the
first month they lived together quite happily, in the second month
they quarrelled, in the third month they took to living in separate
houses, and at the end of four months they were not on speaking
terms! Then there are other men who cannot stand living alone. They
have no personal occupation, they become depressed, take to whiskey
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> large
quantities—or worse, and therein lies the way to madness.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of marriage. In most cases the
authorities do not encourage, or rather do not allow, men to marry.
They very reasonably consider that married men are unsuitable for
desert work; they either leave their wives in Egypt, and worry
about them, which is not surprising, or they manage to “wangle” a
permission out of the powers that be and take their wives out to
the desert. Then, of course, a married man is stationed in a
pleasanter place than one who has no wife. It is a difficult
problem, and in most cases results in men wasting the prime of
their life in a bachelor condition on the desert.</p>

<p>But one was kept fairly busily employed at Siwa. A considerable
part of the work consisted in judging cases, similar to the duties
of a magistrate at home (this, to my mind, was the most interesting
part of the routine); also there was a section of Camel Corps to
keep in training, and the local police. I went out on patrol for a
few days every month, but after once exploring the whole
neighbourhood these “treks” were not exciting. Most of the law
cases were not of great interest; they consisted mainly of petty
thefts, assaults and infringement of Government regulations.
Divorce and questions of inheritance were not supposed to be dealt
with by me, as they came before a special Mohammedan court, whose
representative, an old kadi, went on circuit every year, though he
always avoided Siwa, owing to the tedious journey<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> and the huge file of cases
that were waiting for his decision. The Siwans knew almost to the
penny how much they would have to give him for a favourable
decision on any case.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, I did get curious cases, and the following
one illustrates the social conditions in the town.</p>

<p>A young Siwan woman called Booba, about fifteen years old, after
a series of very varied matrimonial experiences, married an Arab
who was settled in the town. Although she had been married many
times she was considered a very respectable person and related to
one of the leading sheikhs. Divorce is considered no disgrace, and
a divorced woman does not lose caste as in other parts of the
country. Very soon the Arab husband died. This occurred in January,
by the end of March she had married again; this time her husband
was a Siwan merchant. He quickly grew tired of her and divorced her
after a month of married life, but he treated her well and paid the
residue of her marriage money to her brother who was her nearest
male relation. She returned to her brother’s family, who were by no
means pleased to see her. Being an exceptionally good-looking girl
she was courted again by another man, the young son of a sheikh,
who was considered rather a “catch.” He married her in June, and
very soon after she gave birth to a child. As the child was a girl,
the husband divorced her two days after its birth. The wretched
woman was turned out of the house in the night by her late
mother-in-law. She managed to get to her<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_174">[174]</span> own home, but her brother’s wife refused to
let her in. The brother himself was away. Eventually she found a
lodging with an old woman, a relative of one of the earlier
husbands, who had, it seemed, some liking for the girl. While
staying here the child died—possibly from exposure, possibly from
other reasons.</p>

<p>Immediately the families of the last three husbands hurried to
give information against her, and charged her with murdering the
child. The doctor examined it and found signs of possible
suffocation. I listened for several days to the evidence of a
number of witnesses, mostly repulsive old women who enlarged with
horrid keenness on the most disagreeable details. But eventually
nothing was proved, and the girl was acquitted. It was a
disagreeable case, but one could almost find parallels to it in the
English police-court news.</p>

<p>Female witnesses at Siwa were very difficult to manage. They
never spoke or understood any Arabic, so the six sheikhs, who acted
as a jury, interpreted for them. I used to sit on a platform at one
end of the room, and the six sheikhs occupied a bench along one
side. Women pretended to hate coming into the court-house, but I
think they really rather enjoyed it. The orderly, one of the
police, would firmly propel the lady into the middle of the room,
she being completely covered from head to foot with clothes. As
soon as the orderly retired she sidled over to the wall and propped
herself against it, generally with her back turned on me. The
sheikhs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> would
remonstrate, “For shame, turn round Ayesha, daughter of Osman, and
speak to the noble officer.” The lady would wriggle round a little
and allow one eye to appear through the drapery. When questioned
she mumbled inaudible replies, growing slightly more coherent if
she was personally concerned in the case, but if there was another
woman giving evidence she would gradually lower her veils, speak
louder, and finally show her whole face as she shrieked abuse at
her opponent—quite regardless of the eyes of the court. The sheikhs
were invaluable on these occasions; it would have been very
difficult to work without them.</p>

<p>One woman, who sued her neighbour for throwing stones at her
hens, disturbed the court considerably. When she was led in by the
policeman she appeared particularly cumbered with clothes. Suddenly
a terrific disturbance began among her shawls and draperies; she
gave a shrill squeal and two hens disentangled themselves from her
clothes and dashed madly round the court-house. Two of my dogs, who
were lying at my feet, sprang after the birds and chased them round
the room, which plunged the proceedings into the wildest confusion.
The woman had carried in the hens intending to confront her
opponent, at the critical moment, with the injured victims. Judging
from their activity they had not been much injured.</p>

<p>One man, Bashu Habun, son of the old sheikh who was hanged,
caused more legal work than the whole of the rest of the population
together. He spent his<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_176">[176]</span> time appropriating the property of one of
his brothers who was in prison. The brother had an agent in Siwa, a
foolish old sheikh called Soud, who was too honest, or stupid, to
withstand the sly cleverness of Bashu Habun. At one time there were
seven cases between them, involving many hundreds of pounds. I
settled the first three, but found that the latter dealt with
inheritance, and so were beyond my jurisdiction, but I got heartily
sick of the sharp, foxy face of Bashu Habun and the noisy, foolish
obstinacy of old Sheikh Soud. Both of them tried to secure my
support by sending donkey-loads of fruit to my house before the
cases were tried, and on one occasion the servants met both
bringing presents, and returned together with their offerings to
the town. The idea of “baksheesh” is so firmly planted in the
native mind that it takes a long while to die out. Still, one finds
that the natives really appreciate and prefer an impartial
administration of justice, in place of justice—of sorts—which
depends on which of the two parties can offer the highest bribe to
the judge. The Senussi were by no means above this method, but they
let political considerations weigh equally with “baksheesh” on
their scale of justice. In the days when a Turkish governor ruled
in Siwa he made his money by accepting and extorting bribes, and
if, when British Administration retires from Egypt, the oasis is
ruled again by a native mamur, the same system will possibly
flourish.</p>

<p class="dcap">SIWA itself is the largest, richest and most
important oasis in a little group of oases which are mostly
uninhabited. Similar oases, such as the Kufra group and the Augila
group, are scattered at intervals, few and very far between, over
the vast arid surface of the great Sahara desert. In most of them
there are fresh-water springs surrounded by small patches of green,
which have an appearance of almost magical beauty to those who
arrive at them, weary after days of travel over the hot and barren
solitudes of the desert. Ancient poets compared the yellow desert
to a leopard’s tawny skin, spotted with occasional oases. Doubtless
when Siwa was more thickly populated than it is to-day each of the
outlying ones was inhabited, but now the ever-shrinking population
is insufficient even to cultivate all the gardens in the immediate
vicinity of Siwa itself.</p>

<p>About 20 miles east of Siwa town, at one end of a long salt
lake, there is a village called Zeitoun, and close by it a cluster
of rich gardens which are the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_178">[178]</span> finest and best cared-for in the oasis,
famous for the olives which give the place its name. In the whole
of Siwa there are about 40,000 fruit-bearing olive trees, and a
large quantity of olive oil is manufactured locally. Rough wooden
olive presses are used by the natives, which are so primitive that
a large proportion of the oil is wasted. The oil is of an excellent
quality and is very profitable when exported, but owing to the
difficulty of obtaining suitable tins and vessels to store it in
only a small amount is sent up to the coast. It is bought by the
Greeks at Matruh and Sollum, who dilute it and sell it at an
enormous profit to the Arabs.</p>

<p>Along the shores of the lake there are several other groups of
gardens, and at one of them the ex-Khedive proposed to start a
model farm, but as usual he got no further in his scheme than
erecting some huts for the labourers to live in. He also did a
certain amount of excavating in this neighbourhood, and according
to hearsay he carried away camel-loads of “antikas” which he dug up
among some ruins at a place called Kareished. Some of the gardens
slope right down to the shores of the lake, and there are several
fine springs among them. I often thought that Kareished would be
quite a pleasant place to live in if one built a good house and had
a boat to cross the lake to Siwa. The people in these outlying
villages ride into Siwa town every few days to do their shopping,
across a long causeway which divides the lake and the mud
swamp.</p>

<p>North-east of Zeitoun, across 90 miles of high<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> desert tableland, one comes to
the oasis of Gara, or “Um es Sogheir”—the Little Mother. The word
“Um”—mother—is used indiscriminately by the Arabs in names of
places, hills, valleys and rocks. According to one theory this
practice originates from very ancient times when places were named
after certain female deities or goddesses. Gara is a lonely valley
about 10 miles long and 5 miles wide, surrounded by precipitous
cliffs that one can only descend in a few places, sprinkled with
vast isolated masses of rock, upon one of which the village is
perched. Many of the rocks have had their bases so worn away that
they look like gigantic mushrooms, and one can camp most
comfortably in their shade as under an umbrella. There are nine
wells and springs in the oasis, but the water has an unpleasant
bitter taste, which is mentioned in the accounts of Alexander’s
journey to Siwa. Owing to the bad water and lack of labour the
Garites are unable to grow anything except dates of a poor quality
and a few onions and tomatoes. Grapes and fruit trees will not
flourish in the oasis. The people eke out a miserable existence by
selling dates, mats and baskets to the caravans which pass between
Siwa and Egypt. They are wretchedly poor, exceedingly dirty and
very distinctly darker in complexion than the Siwans. In former
days they were too weak-spirited to be aggressive and too poor to
be attacked, although owing to the position of Gara on the
Siwa-Egypt caravan route they might easily have made themselves
very awkward to travellers by levying a toll on<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> convoys calling at Gara for
water on their way to Egypt.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw3">
<figure id="i17"><img src='images/i17.jpg' alt=''>
<p class="cp1">THE SPRING OF ZEITOUN</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>But on the one solitary occasion when the Garites did attempt to
do this they fared very badly. According to the tradition a famous
religious sheikh called Abdel Sayed was travelling from Tripoli to
join the pilgrim caravan at Cairo. He had with him a few attendants
and some devout men who were also on their way to do the
Pilgrimage. When they halted at Gara the inhabitants, instead of
feeling honoured and entertaining the travellers, came out of the
town and attacked them. The sheikh and his followers managed to
escape, and when they were safely out of the valley the venerable
Abdel Sayed stood on a rock and solemnly cursed the people of Gara,
swearing that there should never be more than forty men alive in
the village at once. Since then, although the total number of
inhabitants is over a hundred, there have never been more than
forty full-grown men. When the number exceeds forty, one of them
dies. On this account the Garites have a great objection to
strangers, and when I arrived, with a dozen fully grown Camel Corps
men, the sheikh anxiously begged me to forbid them to enter the
village, but as there were under forty men living there at the time
I myself and an orderly went up into the town. Presumably if we had
all walked up several of the Garites must have died.</p>

<p>The village is a miserable imitation of Aghourmi, but dirty and
squalid. A steep winding pathway<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_181">[181]</span> leads up the rock to the gateway, and in
the centre there is a square open market where nothing is ever
bought or sold as nobody has any money except the sheikh, and he
spends it at Siwa when he rides in every fortnight on a donkey to
report at the Markaz. The sheikh himself is an intelligent man, but
scarcely able to speak any Arabic. One of his duties is to look
after the telephone from Siwa which passes Gara on its way to
Matruh. This telephone was erected by the army after the Senussi
operations, and is remarkably clear considering the distance of
desert which it crosses. My visit caused a great sensation, as the
people had not seen an Englishman for a very long time. The
inhabitants came out to my camp and sat in silent rows gazing at
us, until they were politely “moved on,” and the women spent the
whole day looking down on us from the roofs. I believe, during the
war, a car patrol visited the place, but as the sheikh said, “They
came—whirrrr—and they went—brrrrr!”</p>

<p>According to another legend some bedouin raiders once attacked
Gara. The people retired to the village, shut the gates, and prayed
to the patron sheikh, who is buried outside, for help. The spirit
of the dead sheikh rose to the occasion and so dazzled the eyes of
the enemy that they wandered round and round the rock and were
totally incapable of finding the gate. Eventually they became so
exhausted that the Garites were emboldened to come down from the
town and kill them. The old muezzin of the mosque of Gara related
this story to me, and an<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_182">[182]</span> audience of Garites, who evidently knew it
well, with what I considered unjustifiable pride, and he did not
seem to think at all that his forebears had played rather a
cowardly part in this signal victory.</p>

<p>Between Siwa and Gara there is a pass through a rocky gorge
called Negb el Mejberry. Across the track there is a line of fifty
little heaps of stones, each a few feet high. Once, many years ago,
a rich caravan set out from Siwa to the coast, via Gara. They
reached the negb (pass) at twilight and noticed the heaps of
stones, but thought nothing of it. Suddenly, when they were quite
close to them, a bedouin leaped up from behind each heap and rushed
on the caravan. With great difficulty the merchants beat off the
robbers, and the ambuscade failed, but not without several men
being killed. The merchants buried them close to the place, which
is haunted to-day by the ghosts of the brigands who still appear
lurking behind the stone heaps. The pass has an evil reputation,
and natives prefer to cross it in broad daylight, and not when the
sinking sun plays strange tricks with the shadows of the rocks, or
when the moon lends an air of mystery to the rugged ravine.</p>

<p>Due west of Zeitoun there is a string of “sebukha”—salt
marshes—which lie at the foot of a line of cliffs, a continuation
of the mountains that surround Siwa on the north. In this country,
which is rarely crossed, one finds little plantations of gum trees
that remind one of the Sudan, and also patches<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_183">[183]</span> of camel thorn bushes. I have not seen
these growing in any other part of the Western Desert. Possibly
they may have grown from seeds dropped by caravans passing up from
the Sudan. There is no fresh water in this area, but the country is
very full of gazelle.</p>

<p>South-west of Siwa there are two other uninhabited oases, El
Areg and Bahrein—the two lakes. El Areg is a very surprising place.
Riding along the flat rocky stretch of country on the east of the
Pacho mountains, named after a European explorer who visited Siwa
in the early nineteenth century, one arrives suddenly on the brink
of a precipice which is the top of the cliffs that surround the
oasis. There are two steep, difficult paths leading down between
enormously high white rocks with bunches of straggling, overgrown
palm trees at their foot. Much of the oasis is a salt marsh, but at
one end there is a mass of bushes and tall palm trees, with two
springs of drinkable water among them. The cliffs are very high
indeed, and their whiteness makes them look strange at night. In
places there are stretches of fossilized sea-shells, and I
especially noticed sea-urchins and starfish. In a kind of bay in
the cliff, between two enormous high rocks, there is a natural
terrace, and in the centre of the terrace there are remains of a
building; in the surrounding cliffs, sometimes so high up on the
face that one wonders how and why they were made, there are the
square entrances of rock tombs or dwellings. Some of them are quite
large, but in all cases very low. All the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_184">[184]</span> lower ones are full of skulls and human
skeletons, but many are so covered with sand-drifts that I could
not get inside. The oasis is full of gazelle, which feed on the
luscious vegetation round the marshes.</p>

<p>At Bahrein there are two long, brilliantly blue salt lakes,
fringed with a tangled mass of vegetation and palm trees,
surrounded by yellow sand-dunes. Bahrein always reminded me of</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent4">“A tideless, dolorous, midland sea;</div>

<div class="line indent0">In a land of summer, and sand, and
gold.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Here also are rock tombs in some of the cliffs, and
in one of them I discovered the remains of a coloured mural
painting, a picture very much obliterated, of a cow and some palm
trees with large clusters of dates on them, roughly done in brown
and blue colours. Evidently at one time the oasis was inhabited,
and if one sought complete seclusion it would be quite a pleasant
place to live in. There are several thousands of date palms at El
Areg and Bahrein which would produce fruit if they were pruned and
looked after. At one time men used to come out from Siwa and tend
the trees, collecting the fruit later on, but now there is not
enough labour in Siwa to cultivate all the gardens, so both these
oases are deserted. The route from Siwa to Farafra passes through
El Areg and Bahrein, and there is another caravan track from El
Areg to the Baharia oasis, and thence to the valley of the Nile,
which it touches somewhere near Assiut. But practically no
travellers pass this way, and the Mashrabs are almost lost to
knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>West of Siwa
town, at the end of the lake, at the foot of an enormous
flat-topped mountain, there is a little hamlet called Kamissa, and
a number of gardens. Beyond this, if one crosses the cliffs by a
rocky pass, one arrives at a valley called Maragi, where there is
another salt lake surrounded by gardens which belong to a colony of
about sixty Arabs who settled here some fifty years ago and have
remained ever since. They do not intermarry with the Siwans but
“keep themselves to themselves,” as they consider that they are
very superior to the natives. They live in tents and breed sheep
and cattle, and are to all appearances similar to the Arabs on the
coast, except that they have no camels. At one time two of these
Arabs moved into Siwa and settled in houses, but they were regarded
as renegades by the remainder. Further west there is yet another
salt lake called Shyata, a long patch of blue among the yellow
sand-hills, with good grazing around it and fresh water which can
be obtained by digging in certain places, which one needs to know
from experience, as there is no indication of its whereabouts.</p>

<p>North-west of Shyata there is a cluster of uninhabited oases,
Gagub, Melfa and Exabia. They are queer wild places with wonderful
rock scenery, huge towering limestone cliffs, deep morasses, and
stretches of shining water, edged with rotting palm trees, like</p>

appearance, one could well imagine the witches of Macbeth
celebrating their midnight orgies in such places. At night a

<p class="nind">and the dead branches on the gaunt palm trunks sway
like corpses on a gallows tree. When I trekked in these parts I
always tried to camp for the night above the cliffs, but this was
no easy matter, as in places they rose perpendicularly from the
ground.</p>

<p>Yet the presence of innumerable sepulchral chambers cut in the
cliffs shows that these melancholy valleys were once inhabited. The
water here is practically undrinkable. At Gagub there is a well,
and on one occasion my men all drank from it, but it was so
strongly impregnated with sulphur that it had the same effect as a
very powerful dose of physic! There is a great difference between
these deep gloomy valleys, with their oozing marshes and dead
funereal palm trees, and Siwa itself, with its rich gardens, cool
defiles and long green vistas among the trees. From the top of a
hill near Melfa, the westernmost oasis, one can see the dome of the
mosque at Jerabub. In Siwa the mosques have no domes, so one
becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
unaccustomed to the sight of them, and for this reason the dome at
Jerabub looks quite impressive, though it is actually only about
the size of those that one sees over tombs in numbers of the
cemeteries of Cairo.</p>

<p>Jerabub used to be the Mecca of Senussiism, but what glory it
ever had has now passed away. To-day it only contains about a
hundred half-starving natives, and a few old sheikhs who still
teach the children in the zowia (religious school). Lately the
people were in such sore straits that the Senussi Wakil, Sidi
Ahmed, had to send down a convoy of grain from the coast, and the
Siwans who rode into Jerabub to sell things returned with their
goods and complained that nobody had any money to spend. The dates
in the Jerabub gardens are very inferior, so the Siwans export
quite a lot of dates to their neighbours.</p>

<p>The only man of any wealth in Jerabub was an old retired
merchant called Mohammed el Ithneini. He was so old, and so
enormously fat, that he was unable to walk, and had to be carried
about by his slaves in a litter. In his day he had been a great
merchant, travelling between Tripoli, Wadai, Egypt and the Sudan,
and in course of time he had amassed considerable riches. But
lately, finding himself short of cash, with a large family to
support, he began to raise money on his belongings.</p>

<p>One day I got information that two men from Jerabub had passed
through Siwa on their way to the coast and Egypt without coming to
the office to see whether they had anything on which to
pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span> customs.
Customs are collected at Siwa on imports from the west. I sent a
patrol after them and brought them back to the Markaz. One of them
was a grandson of the old sheikh, and the other was his cousin. I
examined their camels, and ordered them to turn out their bags,
which they did very reluctantly. They spread the contents out on
the steps of the Markaz. It was quite like a scene from the Arabian
Nights. There were heavy silver anklets, curiously chased bangles,
silver earrings shaped like a young moon with filigree bosses from
which hung long silver chains with little pendants, rings,
brooches, necklaces, several small lumps of gold, two complete sets
of trappings and armour for an Arab horse made of silver-gilt and
gold-fringed velvet, filigree ornaments and cases for charms and a
little bag full of seed pearls; all this was emptied out of two
dirty old leather bags. It made a fine show shining in the sunlight
and I longed to make a bid for some of it, but I came to the
conclusion that it couldn’t be done. They were taking it to sell to
a certain merchant in Cairo, so I sent them up with a Camel Corps
patrol who were going to the coast, as already the Siwans were
casting envious eyes on the stuff. The men returned two months
later and told me that they got £140 for the lot, which I myself
had estimated as being worth a very great deal more. For several
years the old merchant had been sending stuff to be sold in Cairo,
and every year I imagine he received as small a price.</p>

<p>Among the valuables in his house there are a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> number of old Persian and
Turkish carpets, but these he keeps as they are too heavy to send
about. I had entered into negotiations with him about some of
these, but just when the bargain was being completed I got a bad
“go” of fever and had to leave for the coast. A few of the Siwan
sheikhs have good carpets, but they know their worth and are very
unwilling to part with them. Other household articles that some
Siwans possess and are very proud of are large brass Turkish
samovars which they use with charcoal for making tea. Their owners
say that they were originally brought from Constantinople, but now
they have become quite like heirlooms, and curiously enough they do
not seem to wear out.</p>

<p>South of Siwa, beyond the shifting yellow sand-hills, there is a
vast stretch of desert without a single shred of vegetation which
reaches down to the Sudan. Only the first hundred miles has been
explored, beyond that is <em>terra incognita</em>. The Arabs call
this the Devil’s country, and rightly so. In these huge silent
spaces one sees incessant mirage, for which the native name is
Devil’s water, and frequently “the genii of the storm, urging the
rage of whirlwind,” sends a high hurricane of hot stinging sand
tearing across the desert, smothering men and beasts in blinding
dust, snatching up anything that is loose and bearing it away.</p>

<p>I once trekked down here in summer-time on the track of some
gun-runners who were supposed to be making for Egypt from the west.
It is a dreary region, horribly dead and monotonous, consisting of
alternate stretches of hard ground covered with shining black
pebbles, and white sand-dunes, stretching east and west, where the
sand is so soft and powdery that camels and men sink deep into it,
and the surface is so hot that one can hardly bear to feel it.
There are no tracks or mashrabs, and we were the first party to set
up cairns on the hills, wherever there were stones. If one
travelled on and on for about a thousand miles one would arrive at
Darfur, in the north-west corner of the Sudan. Until the war Darfur
was an independent kingdom whose Sultan, Ali Dinar, reigned from
his capital El Fasher in a similar manner to the Sultan of
Wadai.</p>

<p>The Kufra, sometimes spelt “Kufara,” group of oases lie
south-west of Siwa, but owing to its distance from all civilization
Kufra was never of any importance historically or politically,
though comparatively lately it has become a convenient retreat for
some of the Senussi sheikhs. Quite a number of natives who had
recently been in Kufra visited Siwa during the time that I was
there, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> I
questioned them, and various Siwans who knew Kufra well, they all
described it as being very thinly populated, less fertile and very
inferior to the Siwa oasis—from their point of view. When I
discussed the possibilities of visiting it they were exceedingly
surprised at the idea of anybody wishing to see Kufra, which they
described as being “muskeen”—wretched—but at the same time they
said that the people in Kufra would certainly not object to anybody
going there, as it was in no way a sacred place like Jerabub used
to be at one time. At Kufra there is no strange metropolis like
that of Siwa, and as recently as 1854 an English traveller who
visited Jalow and Augila stated that Kufra was practically
uninhabited, except during a certain month of the year when natives
from the other oases went there in order to gather the dates.</p>

<p>There is a great fascination in travelling over unexplored
desert; somehow I always had the feeling that perhaps beyond the
rocky skyline, or perhaps over the next ridge of sand-hills, there
might possibly appear the languidly swaying palm trees of some
unknown oasis. Nobody has penetrated into the heart of this desert,
and it is not beyond the realms of possibility that there are
oases, either inhabited like the lost land of Atlantis or like the
mysterious desert cities that the story-tellers describe to their
evening audience in the market-place, hidden away among those
unmapped plains of the Sahara.</p>

<p>There are still great possibilities of excavating at Siwa, and
in the outlying oases, which have been<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_192">[192]</span> even less explored, but I myself had
neither the leisure nor the money to do any serious digging. In
many parts of the oasis, sometimes in the middle of a palm grove,
one finds what appear to be the foundations of ancient buildings,
made of well-squared stones; and many of the rock tombs, especially
in the cliffs of the more distant oases, still contain mummies. I
examined a number of them myself, but with no luck, as they were,
apparently, of a very inferior class and had no ornaments buried
with them. Near some of them there were broken earthenware pots of
an antique shape not made in Siwa to-day. All the tombs whose
entrances are visible in the Hill of the Dead, the great rock
mausoleum outside Siwa town, have been rifled many year ago and
nothing is left except scattered bones, skulls and scraps of grave
wrappings. A few of the finest tombs have been converted into
dwellings by some poor Siwans who are courageous enough to brave
the demons of the hill in order to secure a freehold residence,
cool in summer and warm in winter, and scented with the</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">But on the whole Siwans strongly disapprove of
interfering with the tombs, although they firmly believe that some
of the hills near the town contain hidden treasure, more

</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>All
the more obvious places, such as the ruins of the Temple of Jupiter
Ammon, at Omm Beyda, have been thoroughly dug about, but after
spending some time in the oasis one comes across various places
that appear to be untouched—virgin soil for the excavator.</p>

<p>Behind the hill on which my house, Kasr Hassuna, was built there
stood another great, isolated, limestone rock about 70 feet high
with a circumference of about 400 yards. One evening, when I was
climbing on this rock looking for a hawk’s nest, I came across the
entrance of what I supposed to be a cave right at the top. I went
in, but as I found that it stretched far into the rock I sent for
my servants and an electric torch; then armed with this I pushed on
into the darkness. There was a narrow tunnel about 5 feet high and
3 feet wide cut out of solid rock, and sloping downwards so steeply
that in some places one could almost have sat down and tobogganed
along. The tunnel, which was about 10 or 11 yards long, terminated
at the mouth of a deep, dark shaft like a well, going straight down
into the depths of the earth. I did no more exploring that day.</p>

<p>On the next morning some of the sheikhs, who had evidently heard
of my discovery from the servants, told me the following story very
solemnly. Many years ago, in the time of their grandfathers, Sheikh
Hassuna, the owner of the kasr—castle—discovered, as I had, the
tunnel in the rock. He naturally supposed that it was the entrance
to a place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> of
hidden treasure, but he did not like the idea of going down the
shaft himself, and he could find nobody else who would. There was
at this time a very venerated Fiki in Siwa, and eventually Sheikh
Hassuna persuaded him to make the first descent, in order that he
might exorcise the jinns and make it safe for the sheikh to secure
the treasure. The Fiki was lowered at the end of a rope, with a
torch, a Koran and a supply of incense. A few seconds afterwards
the people who were in the tunnel and looking into the pit were
startled by a rushing of wings and a great cloud of black smoke,
which was the jinns escaping from the place. When they hauled up
the Fiki he told them the following tale. At the bottom of the pit
there was a vast chamber hewn out of stone, and at one end of it
there was an iron door. When the Fiki began to read from the Koran
the door swung open and two terrible jinns passed out of it,
escaped up the shaft, and another jinn, a female, with huge wings,
appeared and ordered him to depart and to warn all others never to
visit the place again. So since that day nobody in Siwa disturbed
the genii of the hill. Finally, the sheikhs advised me, if I would
go down, to take with me somebody who could read the Koran.</p>

<p>The same afternoon I called on an old Sudanese Fiki, called Haj
Gabreen, and invited him to come exploring with me. He was a
stalwart old Sudani about sixty years old, much respected by his
compatriots of the Camel Corps and reputed skilful in doctoring and
magic. He was decidedly nervous,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_195">[195]</span> but at length agreed to come, mainly, I
suppose, owing to the audience of Camel Corps men who were
listening. The affair was now, to my mind, patronized by the
Church. I got a dozen of my stoutest men and a long rope. They
lowered me down first, then a couple of men, followed by the Fiki
who bumped from side to side with many groans and ejaculations of
“Ya salaam”—“wallahi.” It was very disappointing. The shaft was
about 25 feet deep, narrow at the top, but widening as it got
lower. At the bottom there certainly was a sort of chamber cut out
of the rock, but very roughly done; the floor of it was covered
with a mass of loose stone and rubble which had evidently fallen in
at some time, possibly during one of the earthquakes which are
mentioned as occurring frequently at Siwa by the eighteenth-century
travellers who visited the oasis. There was absolutely nothing in
the shape of a door or a tomb, but one could not tell what there
was further down as it was choked with loose stuff.</p>

<p>I had men working at it for several days, trying to clear out
the debris, but there seemed to be no end to it, and as one had to
haul up every basket of stone to the top and then pass it from hand
to hand along the tunnel, the difficulty was very great. The
atmosphere, too, was very close and hot. Eventually we came to some
large pieces of detached rock which we were unable to raise, and as
the work had no appreciable result I finally gave it up.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards I went to see the tombs of the kings at
Thebes. My orderly, who had been at<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_196">[196]</span> Siwa, was with me, and we were both struck
by the similarity between the tombs of the kings and the
underground place at Siwa, the latter of course being on a very
small scale. Later, when I discovered that Siwa was at one time
famous for its emerald mines, the idea suggested itself that this
might have been an old mine. Unfortunately, not being an
archæologist, I was unable to determine from the size and
construction of the place whether it was likely to be a tomb or
not. I afterwards discovered another passage, narrow but higher,
cut into the outside of the rock about half-way down, apparently
with the idea of tapping the shaft, but it only reached a few yards
and then seemed to have been left uncompleted.</p>

<p>Haj Gabreen, the old Fiki who went down the shaft with me,
evidently spread a very fantastic rumour of my discoveries, because
after I left Siwa I got messages from the Governor inquiring
whether I really had found an iron door in the middle of the
hill.</p>

<p>There seemed to be an abnormally large number of old men in
Siwa, as the climate is apparently conducive to old age. Siwans,
like many other natives, are very vague about their own ages. Often
if one asks them how old they are they reply, “Whatever age you
would wish,” or sometimes, “The same age as your Excellency”—which
they seem to consider a polite answer. Certainly most of the deaths
that occur are those of young children or very old people.
Considerable deference is paid to old age, although it may not
always be accompanied by corresponding<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_197">[197]</span> virtue. When I was at Siwa the “Oldest
Inhabitant” was a wrinkled old man called Haj Suliman, the
grandfather of one of the principal merchants. He used to spend
most of his time sitting outside his house gossiping to the
passers-by, and I often stopped to talk to him. Unfortunately he
was deaf and had no teeth, so conversation between us was not very
brisk. He and his relations told me that he was 102 years old; he
looked about 90, and could not have been less than 85. He used to
tell me about his one and only visit to Cairo, some sixty years
ago, on his way home from Mecca. He also remembered and described
quite clearly the visit of a certain English traveller to Siwa in
1869.</p>

<p>One day I heard a great deal of noise in the neighbourhood of
Haj Suliman’s house; on inquiry I was told that there was a
“fantasia” going on, so I strolled over to see it. I found a number
of dancers, music in the shape of drums and whistles, and free
“lubki” being handed round. Carpets were spread in the courtyard
and Haj Suliman, very gaily dressed, was receiving the company,
surrounded by his sons and grandchildren. He looked very pleased
with himself and invited me to drink tea, which I did. All the time
he stood near, evidently expecting me to say something to him.
Eventually I asked him why he was giving a “fantasia”—at which the
whole family began talking and telling me that it was for a
wedding. “But where is the bridegroom?” I asked, and Haj Suliman
leant forward with a silly grin on his antique face. Then, to my
amazement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span> they
told me that the old gentleman himself was the bridegroom, this
being his thirty-sixth wedding and the bride was 14 years old. I
realized that he had been expecting my congratulations, so I
offered them, as he was evidently not of the opinion that “crabbed
age and youth cannot live together.” He died suddenly about eight
months later, “a victim of connubiality.” I had seen him the day
before in his garden working hard with an enormous iron hoe as big
as a spade, which is much used in Siwa.</p>

<p>Another very old man in Siwa was an aged Sudani who sold a queer
little collection of oddments in a corner of the market. At one
time he had acted as postman for the Senussi between Siwa and
Kufra. He told me, and I heard it besides from various sources,
that he used to go alone to Kufra by a track across the sand-dunes
south of Siwa. He was paid three pounds for each trip, but the
danger was enormous; if his camel had strayed or fallen ill he
would have been absolutely done for. Another queer old character
was an old woman called Hanoui, who was at one time a secret agent
and remarkably clever at acquiring information. She was also useful
when one wanted to get baskets made.</p>

<p>The only real industry in Siwa, and it is not an important one,
is the making of mats and basket work from palm fronds. Mats and
large coarse hampers for carrying dates on camels are made by men.
The mats are usually round, very strong, lasting and useful. The
Arabs buy large quantities<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_199">[199]</span> of them when they come down for dates in
the autumn. The baskets are made entirely by women. They are
manufactured from thin strips of palm leaves which become like
raffia; sometimes they are coloured with dye, but the better kinds
are ornamented with minute patterns of coloured silk worked into
the sides, and decorated with tassels of variegated coloured silks
and scarlet leather flaps in which to fasten cords for holding
them.</p>

<p>The work is very fine indeed, so fine that in some cases the
baskets will even hold water. They are made in various shapes, but
generally round with a conical cover. Besides baskets they make
dishes and platters with covers to them, which are used for
carrying food and fruit. These baskets are exceedingly attractive
and useful and command a high price in Cairo and in England. They
are very light and can be made in “nests” of five or six, in order
to be more easily conveyed. They are very distinctive and quite
different to those that are made at Assuan, in Sinai, or the
Sudan.</p>

<p>Siwan women also make a rough kind of pottery. They get the clay
from a hill near Siwa, and another kind of clay which they make
into paint from another place on the oasis. The pottery is all made
by hand, not on a wheel, so it is very rough, but it acquires a
good colour and a slight glaze. It is used for making bowls,
dishes, pitchers and little braziers for a charcoal fire on which
the kettle is kept hot when the Siwans make tea. These utensils are
ornamented with rude patterns of a darker colour, the
ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> being
generally yellow, or a reddish brown. I found that there was one
old man in Siwa who was a professional toy-maker, which is an
occupation that one rarely comes across among Mohammedans, all
forms of statues or images being forbidden by the Koran as tending
towards the worship of idols. But the Siwan children have dolls and
toy animals, and they are very cleverly made, too. This old man
made them chiefly of rags stuffed with sawdust, and they really
compared very favourably with the “Teddy bears” and other
monstrosities that one sees at home. Siwan children are queer
little things, very solemn and not as lively as the small Sudanese.
They start working at an early age, and before that they seem to
spend most of their time dabbling about in the streams among the
gardens. One difference that one notices between these small
children and ones of the same age at home is that the former are
not given to the tiresome habit of continually asking
questions.</p>

<p>In trying to develop the basket-making industry one meets with
many difficulties. The women are casual and lazy, so that it is
almost impossible to ensure a definite supply of baskets by a
certain date. The fact that the baskets are made only by women who
live in strict seclusion is a great disadvantage, as one has to
explain everything through a third person. Once as a great
privilege I was allowed to see a woman at work on some baskets. She
was the mother of one of the policemen, quite a venerable old
thing, but for the occasion she sat swathed in a thick<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> veil with only one eye
showing, and thus with great difficulty she gave a demonstration of
how baskets were made. I suggested several new shapes and patterns
which she very quickly understood and taught to the others.</p>

<p>With the bedouin women it is different. During the war,
especially at the close of the Senussi operations, there was great
destitution among the Arabs. Numbers of men who had served with the
Senussi were killed, and many others retired over the frontier and
never returned. Their wives and children were left unprovided for.
As usual the English, against whom they had been fighting, turned
and helped these refugees. Miss Baird, the daughter of the late Sir
Alexander Baird, collected a number of these women and their
children at Amria, in the desert west of Alexandria, and in
conjunction with the F.D.A. started a carpet-making industry. She
lived amongst them herself, superintended the work, and by degrees
she acquired a wonderful influence over them. She became somewhat
like Lady Hester Stanhope in the Lebanon, only her influence was
not due to religious superstition. I once stopped at Amria on my
way from Cairo to Sollum by camel in the early days of the
industry, and I shall never forget my first impression of the four
or five hundred wild bedouin women working away at the carpets like
girls in a factory at home, absolutely controlled by one young
Englishwoman right out in the desert. Miss Baird’s death in 1919
was a very great loss, but the work that she began is still being
carried on by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> the
F.D.A., who have moved the factory from Amria and installed it in
an imposing building at Behig, which is the headquarters of the
Eastern District of the Western Desert.</p>

<p>One of the things that is noticeable at Siwa is the absence of
flowers. Owing to there being no rain there is no sudden burst of
vegetation in the spring, as there is along the coast. At certain
times there is blossom in the gardens on the various trees—apples,
almonds, pomegranates, lemons, etc.—and for a month or two there
are roses and a very heavily scented flowering shrub called
“tamar-el-hindi.” But one does not see the riot of colour that
follows on the track of the rains. There are very few wild animals,
too. In the neighbouring oases one sees gazelle and a few foxes,
and in Siwa itself there are quantities of jackals. According to
the natives an animal which they call “Bakhr wahash”—wild ox—is to
be found at a place called Gagub, an uninhabited oasis, consisting
of a salt lake surrounded by sterile palm trees, between Siwa and
Jerabub. But when I went there I saw no signs of the creature. It
is described as being the size of a donkey, of a yellowish brown
colour, with two horns like a cow’s.</p>

<p>In Siwa there are very few domestic animals. None of the people
keep camels, partly because they have no need for them, and partly
owing to the presence of the “ghaffar” fly which inoculates camels
and horses with a disease that shortens their life very
considerably. For this reason one set of camels belonging to the
F.D.A. remain permanently<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_203">[203]</span> at Siwa in order to avoid spreading the
disease among the camels on the coast. Almost every man in Siwa has
a donkey, and some of the large landowners have thirty or forty.
One meets them everywhere, in the streets trotting along under
enormous loads, but carrying them apparently with the greatest
ease. The Siwans rarely walk any distance, they always ride. The
donkeys are stout little beasts and are better treated on the whole
than in Egypt. They are imported by the Gawazi Arabs from Upper
Egypt and the Fayum, via Farafra, the oasis of “Bubbling Springs,”
which lies south-east of Siwa, but they breed freely in Siwa, and
their diet of dry dates seems to suit them well.</p>

<p>Donkeys are also used as a threshing machine. When the barley is
ripe it is cut and collected and spread out in a circle on a
smooth, hard piece of ground. Ten or fifteen donkeys are harnessed
abreast, in line, and driven round and round over the barley; when
they wheel the innermost donkey moves very slowly, and the outer
ones trot fast. In this way the corn is crushed out of the husks.
Afterwards it is winnowed by the simple process of throwing it up
into the air so that the straw blows away and leaves only grain.
There are about a hundred cows in Siwa; they are small animals,
about the size of a Jersey, but they give very good milk.</p>

<p>At certain times one sees quite a number of birds at Siwa, but
they are mostly migratory. I have noticed crane, duck, flamingo and
geese on the salt lakes; hawks, crows, ravens and owls among
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> cliffs; doves,
pigeon, hoopoes, wagtails and several varieties of small singing
birds in the gardens. Some of them nest in the oasis, and I
collected about a dozen different kinds of eggs, but unfortunately
they all got broken. There is one bird which is, I believe,
indigenous to Siwa, it is known by the natives as “Haj Mawla.” It
is about the size of a thrush, black with white feathers in its
tail, and a very pretty song somewhat similar to the note of a
robin.</p>

<p>Lately the Administration has installed lofts of carrier pigeons
along the coast and at Siwa. On the coast they have been quite
successful, but so far no pigeons have been trained to cross the
desert. The hawks at Siwa are a serious menace to them, and quite a
number have been killed. In former days the Libyan Desert produced
ostriches. Browne, in 1792, mentions that he saw broken eggs and
tracks of ostriches on his way to Siwa. But nowadays there are
none. Many of the lions that were used in the arenas of Rome were
brought from Libya, but these too are now extinct.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">But the Arabs who travel between the Sudan and
Tripoli tell of a long wadi, with water and vegetation, north of
Darfur, which takes three days to cross by camel, and this wadi, so
they say, is full of wild animals—lions, tigers, giraffe,
etc.—which have never been hunted.</p>

<p>Siwa is a bad place for snakes, scorpions and tarantulas. The
cerestes, or horned viper, is very<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_205">[205]</span> common, as well as several other poisonous
species. One of the most deadly is a little light-coloured snake
with a hard prong at the end of its tail like a scorpion, which
lies half covered with sand. I also saw a specimen of the puff
adder. My house seemed to be a favourite abode of snakes, which may
possibly have been because I had a pigeon loft close to it. Several
times I was awakened in the night by my dog barking in the room and
found a big snake slithering along the floor, or underneath the
edge of the matting. Three men were bitten by snakes while I was
there and died as a result; in each case they had stepped on a
snake with bare feet. Strabo relates that in these parts of Africa
the workmen had to wear boots and rub garlic over their feet to
protect themselves. The local cure, which seems quite ineffective,
is to rub the powdered stems of a broombush on to the bite. Nothing
will induce the natives to touch a snake, dead or alive, with their
fingers, as they say the smell sticks to them and attracts other
snakes. I was only once bitten by a scorpion, and unfortunately I
was out on trek without a first-aid box. It was a large, blackish
green scorpion, one of the worst kind, and it caught me on the end
of one of my fingers. But my men knew what to do from previous
experience. They tied my arm tightly at the elbow and the wrist
with a tourniquet, and then cut several gashes with a razor blade
across the finger which had been bitten. It was very painful during
the night, and I had a good deal of fever, but I was none the worse
for it after a couple of days. The cure for a scorpion
bite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> is a powder
made from a snake’s tail, cooked and pounded, and a few of the
natives specialize in making this powder.</p>

<p>There are no snake charmers in Siwa, and I have seen none
anywhere on the Western Desert. In Egypt one meets many, the most
famous perhaps is a man at Luxor. I saw him perform a few days
before I left Egypt, and I was most impressed by his exhibition.
One evening, without any warning, I took him out with me to a place
near Karnak, having first examined him and satisfied myself that he
had no snakes hidden about his clothes. In about a quarter of an
hour he discovered seven or eight snakes. He used no whistle, but
walked about in a very small area muttering to himself, stopping
dead every now and then in front of a stone or a bush, thrusting
his hand into it and withdrawing it clasping a writhing lively
snake. Several of the snakes were known to me as being venomous. He
took two of these, one by one, held them to his wrist, and let them
bite him so that when he pulled them off his flesh they left blood
on his hand. Anybody else would have suffered severely, and would
probably have died, but the snake charmer was immune. His father
and his grandfather had practised the same trade before him, and
according to him they had neither of them suffered in any way by
their profession.</p>

</div>

<p class="dcap">AFTER being some time at Siwa one cannot help
noticing how very much the life of the people is influenced by
their belief in superstitions and magic arts. To every ordinary
accident or natural phenomenon they seem to attach a supernatural
explanation, and they constantly carry out little rites, which have
no apparent purpose, whose origin and reason they do not know, but
which they explain has been the custom “min zamaan.” To believe, as
they do, without knowing, is the grossest form of superstition.
They have a number of purely local customs and practices which are
entirely different to those which are prevalent in Egypt, or among
the Arabs of the Western Desert. The Siwans are Mohammedans, and
strictly religious in most of their observances, but in some of
their habits one can trace a faint resemblance to rites
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> have survived
from former times, long before the people adopted their present
religion. But most of the apparently meaningless practices are
founded on the inherent fear of evil spirits, which are implicitly
believed in by all the inhabitants.</p>

<p>These fabulous beings are of many kinds, and have various
characteristics; there are jinns, in whose veins runs fire instead
of blood, who once inhabited the earth, but sinned and were driven
away by the angels of God; Sheytans, who are children of Iblis, the
Devil; Afreets, Marids; and Ghouls, who are female demons and live
among deserts and graveyards, assuming various forms and luring men
to death. These creatures are usually found in caves, tombs, wells,
empty houses, latrines, and at cross roads. Sometimes they assume
the shapes of men and sometimes they appear in the forms of
domestic animals; in Siwa they are said to favour most the disguise
of a cow.</p>

<p>Among the most ignorant natives one meets with a decided
reluctance to discuss things that are supernatural, but the more
educated men are willing to speak of them. As in all countries the
lower classes are the most credulous. For instance, in the case of
certain old women who are reputed to be witches, the poor people
avowedly believe in them, while the upper classes pretend not to;
but when there is a birth or a wedding in the family of a sheikh,
or a notable, they send presents to these old women saying that it
is merely charity, although at heart they consider it safer to
propitiate them in order to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_209">[209]</span> avert possible misfortune. It is rather
like the lady in church who always bowed at the name of the Devil,
because she thought it safer to be on the right side!</p>

<p>The difference between the customs and superstitions of the
Siwans and those of the Arabs on the desert which surrounds them is
due to the fact that the former are of Berber origin. Their whole
system of living is different, too. The Siwans are town dwellers
whose dominant principle has been a sort of communism, whereas the
Arabs are nomads, who adopted patriarchalism as their method of
rule. The Siwans fought on foot, the Arabs were essentially
cavalry. There are sheikhs in Siwa, but they are more like the
members of a town council, while the real Arab sheikh corresponds
to the feudal lord of the Middle Ages. It is strange to find the
Siwans, with such a definite, different scheme of living, existing
in the midst of a desert whose Arab population regards them almost
as foreigners.</p>

<p>Two distinct kinds of magic are practised in Siwa, Divine magic,
or white magic, and Satanic, or black magic, black being considered
the Devil’s colour. Certain old men and Fikis (readers of the Koran
in the mosques) are supposed to have particular gifts in telling
fortunes, compounding medicines and composing charms against evil,
especially against the much dreaded Evil Eye. They work with the
aid of the Koran, and by reciting long prayers and the names of
Allah. This is legitimate magic. These men are conspicuously
regular in their attendance<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_210">[210]</span> at the mosques, and their power is
attributed to their peculiar goodness. Women are considered by
Mohammedans, and particularly by Siwans, to be by nature more
wicked than men. One Arab writer speaks of woman as “The Devil’s
Arrow,” and another says, “—I stood at the gates of hell and lo,
most of its inmates were women.” Even in the <em>Thousand and One
Nights</em> one reads:</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="lgp">“Verily women are devils created for us, they are
the source of all the misfortunes that have occurred among mankind,
in the affairs of the world and religion—”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">“Verily women are treacherous to everyone
near and distant:</div>

<div class="line indent0">&nbsp;With their fingers dyed with henna:
with their hair arranged in plaits:</div>

<div class="line indent0">&nbsp;With their eyebrows painted with
kohl; they make one drink of sorrow;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is the reason that any skill that the Siwan women possess
in medicine, making amulets, or tracing lost property, is, as a
matter of course, ascribed to their evil practices and their use of
black magic, whereby they are able to invoke demons, ghools and
afreets to carry out their orders, either for good or for evil. For
this reason they keep their doings as secret as possible, and this
secrecy increases their notoriety and evil reputation. But as their
methods are said to be usually successful they are patronized as
much, or even more, than the men, especially by their own sex. So
there is quite a lively rivalry between Fikis, or wizards, and the
wise women, or witches.</p>

<p>Siwan women, owing to their precarious position as wives, are
not fond of bearing children. Many of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_211">[211]</span> them use medicines, made from certain
plants and herbs that grow in the oasis, to prevent childbirth.
Browne mentions, as far back as 1792, that it was a common practice
at Siwa for women to take their newly born infants, probably girls,
up to the top of the walls and throw them over the battlements.
There was one case of child murder reported while I was living
there. Siwan women are not as hardy as Sudanese or Arab women, and
the Egyptian doctor is of course never allowed to attend them for
births. Women are looked after by the Siwan midwives, old women who
have considerable practical experience, but make up for medical
ignorance by a vast knowledge of amazingly futile superstitions. As
a result quite a number of children die at birth. It was suggested
that a Siwan woman should be sent to Cairo and be trained in a
hospital; after much difficulty a suitable woman was found who was
brave enough to be the first Siwan woman to leave the oasis, but
unfortunately the proposition was never carried through.</p>

<p>When the birth of a child occurs in the family of one of the
sheikhs or notables it is celebrated with great rejoicings,
especially if the baby is a boy, as there is an enormous
superfluity of women in Siwa. On the seventh day after the birth
all the female friends and relations of the mother come to the
house to congratulate her, bringing their own children with them.
She receives them with the child and the midwife, herself lying on
the bare floor. It is the custom for all women, even the wives of
the richest sheikhs,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_212">[212]</span> who occasionally have an old brass bedstead
in their room, to sleep on the floor for ten days after giving
birth to a child. A meal is provided for the guests—sweets, cakes,
fruits, Arab tea, and a curious sort of edible clay which is
brought from near Jerabub. This clay is a yellowish colour, tasting
very like a mushroom, and is always eaten by Siwan, and sometimes
by Arab, women when they are expecting a child. But the essential
necessity at this meal is fish, which in a place that is 200 miles
from the sea, and where there are no fresh-water fish of eatable
size, is somewhat difficult to obtain. However, the merchants make
a special point of bringing a species of salted fish from Cairo,
which by the time it arrives at Siwa can be smelt from several
streets away. This delicacy is the <em>chef d’œuvre</em> at
birthday parties. It is curious that the Arabs on the coast, who
could catch fresh fish, have the strongest abhorrence to eating
fish of any kind. The practice at Siwa was inaugurated by the
mother of Sidi Suliman, the patron sheikh, on the birth of her
son.</p>

<p>If the child is a boy the father decides on his name, but in the
case of a girl the mother is sponsor. After the meal everybody
looks at the child and congratulates the mother. Then the midwife,
who is generally a toothless, dirty old hag, mixes some henna and
paints the cheeks of all the children with a red stripe, and they
run out into the streets and markets calling out the names of the
child. The women remain. A large, round, earthenware bowl,
specially made for the occasion, is then brought in and filled with
water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> Each woman
throws into it her bracelets and silver ornaments. They stand in a
circle holding the bowl while the midwife recites the name of the
child, and the others repeat phrases, such as, “May he be happy—may
he be favoured by Allah—may Allah avert all evil from him.” Then
they solemnly raise the bowl several times in the air and let it
drop to the ground; the bowl smashes into atoms, the water splashes
over the floor, the bracelets and bangles roll along the ground,
and the child screams loudly with fright. At this all afreets and
jinns take flight, and the newly born child is blessed with fortune
and riches. Afterwards the women collect their jewellery and return
to their homes. Young children are not washed or kept clean; they
are deliberately made to look as unattractive as possible, at an
early age, in order not to tempt Providence. The Siwans dislike
people to admire their belongings, especially their children, who
are considered most susceptible to the Evil Eye, as it is thought
that nothing can be more valuable than one’s offspring.</p>

<p>The status of a woman in Siwa is low. She is worth less, and is
of less importance, than a donkey. She is worth, in money, a little
less than a goat. There is a strange custom in Siwa which is
absolutely different to that among the Arabs or the Egyptians.
There is a fixed price for a woman; that is to say, the “marriage
money” paid by the man to his future wife’s parents is in all cases
exactly the same—120 piastres (£1 4s.). It makes no difference
whether the girl is young or old, maid or widow, rich or
poor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> exquisitely
beautiful, which is rare, or hideously ugly, which is common; the
only thing that varies is the trousseau of clothes which is given
by the man to his bride, and the quality of this depends on his
means. The present of a poor man would be one gown, one silk
handkerchief, one shawl and one pair of trousers, but a rich man
would give his wife several silk robes and silver ornaments. There
were innumerable quarrels on the subject, especially when wives
were divorced and their husbands tried to keep the clothes (which
belonged rightly to the woman) and give them to the next wife.
Daughters, among the Arabs, if they are sufficiently attractive,
are a source of wealth to their parents, owing to the large amount
of “marriage money” which they can demand, but in Siwa they bring
in practically nothing. Marriage is not a binding institution.
According to the Mohammedan law a wife can be divorced by her
husband merely saying, “I divorce thee,” before two witnesses; he
can do this twice, and after each time, if he changes his mind, he
can order his wife to return to him, and she is compelled to do so.
But if he says it three times, or if he says, “Thou art triply
divorced,” it is irrevocable and he cannot get her back until she
has been married to another man and divorced by him also. But such
a contretemps rarely occurs.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw5">
<figure id="i19"><img src='images/i19.jpg' alt=''>
<p class="cp1">A BRIDE—THE DAUGHTER OE BASHU HABUN BEFORE HER
WEDDING</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>In Siwa a man marries, then divorces his wife as soon as he gets
bored by her, and marries another. One man probably repudiates
several dozen women in his lifetime, but each of them in her turn
is his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> regular,
official and recognized wife. Polygamy is rare, in fact almost
unknown, because when a man fancies a new wife he divorces his
present one; owing to this there is very little promiscuous
immorality, but the line between marriage and prostitution is very
slender. A divorced woman does not lose caste, and in most cases
she appears to have a better chance of marrying again than an
unmarried girl. Men marry at sixteen, and girls from nine to twelve
years old, so a girl of eleven has often been married and divorced
several times. This state of things is simply the ordinary
Mohammedan custom as regards marriage, but carried on in an
absolutely lax manner. It has always been the same in Siwa, and so
it is considered right and proper. It must be so confusing for the
people to remember who is So-and-So’s wife for the time being.
Naturally the prevailing conditions have a very disastrous effect
on the birth-rate.</p>

<p>A first-time marriage in the family of a sheikh or a rich
notable is celebrated by festivities which last sometimes for
several days. On the eve of the wedding, towards sunset time, the
bride dresses in her richest clothes and accompanied by twenty or
thirty girls walks through the gardens to a spring near the town
called Tamousy. This spring is one of the oldest and most beautiful
in Siwa. It is surrounded by stately palm trees and tropical
vegetation; it is deep and very clear and the ancient masonry round
it is still in excellent preservation. As the young bride and her
attendants walk through<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_216">[216]</span> the palm groves they chant a curious tune,
a plaintive melody that sounds more like a dirge than a wedding
song.</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">“As from an infinitely distant land</div>

<div class="line indent0">&nbsp;Come airs, and floating echoes,
that convey</div>

<div class="line indent0">&nbsp;A melancholy into all our
day.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The scene at the spring is very picturesque; the girls and women
stand grouped round the water, their dark robes and silver
ornaments reflected in its blue depths. Very solemnly the bride
removes the large round, silver disc that hangs on a solid silver
ring from her neck, which denotes that she is a virgin; she then
bathes, puts on different clothes and has her hair plaited and
scented by one of her friends. The procession then returns
homewards. On the way they are met by another party of women, the
relations of the bridegroom, who bring presents of money for the
bride, each according to her means. An old woman collects the coins
in a silk scarf, carefully noting the amount given by each
individual, and the two parties return together, singing, through
the palm-bordered paths to the town. These “virginity discs” are
sometimes of great age, having been handed down from mother to
daughter as heirlooms. Formerly they were always made of solid
silver, but now they are often made of lead with a silver
coating.</p>

<p>One evening rather late I was bathing at Ein Tamousy, swimming
round the spring without making much noise. Suddenly I looked up
and saw a large crowd of girls—a wedding party—standing
on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> the path above.
It was most awkward. I splashed loudly, but they were singing and
talking so noisily that they did not hear. Eventually one of them
saw me and screamed out that there was a jinn in the spring,
whereupon the whole crowd fled shrieking into the gardens, leaving
the bride’s wedding garment lying on the ground. I hastily slipped
out, clutched my clothes and dressed hurriedly behind some palm
trees, from whence I watched the party cautiously returning, one by
one, to see whether the monster had disappeared.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bridegroom collects his friends and summons the
Fiki; carpets are spread in the courtyard of his house, which is
illuminated with candles and lanterns, and dishes of food are set
before the guests. As soon as the marriage contract is settled each
guest seizes as much food of any sort as he can possibly hold in
his hand and crams it into his mouth; the more he eats the more he
is supposed to show his friendship for the bridegroom. The usual
tea generally follows. At midnight the bridegroom’s friends and
relations—men, women and children—carrying lanterns and flaring
torches, walk in procession through the narrow streets to the house
of the bride and demand her from her father.</p>

<p>On the return of the bride from her bath she is taken by her
mother and hidden in an upper room of the house. When the
bridegroom’s family have arrived they collect outside the door and
call out, “Bring out the bride, the gallant groom awaits her.” The
girl’s family answer, “We have lost her, we have<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> lost her.” Then “Find her, the
bridegroom is getting impatient,” and the answer is, “She is
asleep, still sleeping.” Then the bridegroom’s family say, “Go,
wake her, and bring her to her man.” Then the women of the bride’s
house weep and scream, and there is a mock fight between the
families. The men flourish their sticks and sometimes actually
strike each other, but eventually the girl is produced and handed
over to the bridegroom’s family by her father. The mock capture of
the bride and the pretended resistance is possibly a survival of
marriage by conquest, or possibly it is meant to denote excessive
modesty on the part of the bride. If one inquires the reason the
Siwans reply that it has been the custom “min zamaan,” and nobody
is any the wiser.</p>

<p>The bride wears her bridal gown, which is a long-sleeved robe of
striped coloured silk and is weighed down with a quantity of silver
ornaments, borrowed, if she has not enough of her own, from her
friends; over this she wears a long woollen blanket entirely
covering her, and she has a sword hung from her right shoulder. In
this costume she rides on a led donkey to the house of the
bridegroom, followed by the people of both families, singing and
beating drums and cymbals. On arrival at the house she is received
by an old woman, usually a Sudanese slave woman, who lifts her off
the donkey, and with the assistance of others carries her across
the threshold, up the stairs, into the bridal room, and lays her on
the couch, taking care that the bride’s feet never<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> touch the ground. The crowd
remain below and are entertained by Zigale dancers, who are hired
for the occasion. Later a sheep is killed at the entrance of the
house, and the blood is smeared across the doorway in the Arab
fashion; and if the family are wealthy several more sheep are
roasted whole and a feast is made for the guests. Thursday is
considered the most propitious day for a wedding, as the girl wakes
up for the first time in her new home on a Friday, which is the
Mohammedan Sunday.</p>

<p>All this time the bridegroom remains in the background, taking
no part in the doings. The old woman who received the bride brings
her some dishes of food and a handful of wheat and salt, which she
places beneath the pillow, where it remains for a week to keep away
bad spirits and afreets who might otherwise be attracted to harm
the newly married couple. Then the bridegroom arrives outside the
door and knocks upon it, on which there follows a long conversation
between him and the old woman. She calls out to him saying what a
beautiful bride he has obtained, describing her as a young moon
with eyes like a gazelle, cheeks like peach blossom and the figure
of a swaying willow. After a high-flown eulogy the bridegroom
inquires, “What is the girl worth?” to which the old woman replies,
“Her weight in silver and gold—” which is queer when one remembers
that she is actually worth £1 4s. The old woman then opens the
door, and after receiving a present from the bridegroom retires and
leaves them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
together. The bridegroom takes the sword from the girl and puts it
under the mattress for use against jinns, takes off the blanket
which entirely covers her, and then removes her right shoe and
strikes her seven times on the foot with the palm of his hand. This
is said to bring luck to the marriage. He stays with her for some
time, but the marriage is not consummated until two days later.
During this time the bridegroom leaves his house and spends his
time in the gardens with one other man, who acts as a sort of best
man.</p>

<p>On the third day the presents from the girl’s family arrive:
carved wooden chests, finely made baskets which have taken several
months to complete, earthenware cooking pots and supplies of sugar
and foodstuffs. The money which was given to the girl at the spring
of Tamousy is counted again, and each of the donors is presented
with some doves, rabbits or chickens, in proportion to the amount
which they gave. Among the Arabs, and especially among the Berbers
of the oases in southern Morocco, an excessive shyness and
bashfulness exists between the bridegroom and his mother-in-law and
all the bride’s near relations. This avoidance and aversion to the
wife’s relatives may be another survival of the idea of marriage by
conquest, but in Siwa one does not find it to such an extent as in
other places. These festivities are only celebrated by the
wealthier natives, and only when the girl is being married for the
first time. Later marriages are quieter affairs, with nothing more
than a little dancing, a free<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_221">[221]</span> distribution of “lubki” and perhaps one
sheep cooked for the guests.</p>

<p>When a Siwan dies his widow is expected to be “ghrula,” that is
in mourning for a month and a half, but the custom has slackened
now and most women marry again as soon as they get the chance.
During the forty-five days the woman dresses in white and keeps to
her house, only going out in the evening after sunset. She lives
plainly, eating no meat and wearing no jewellery. On the last day
of her seclusion the town-crier, accompanied by a boy beating a
drum, announces in the town that the widow of So-and-So will
proceed on the following morning to a certain spring, having
completed her period of mourning. On the next morning a number of
boys run through the streets calling out the same announcement and
warning the people by what road she will pass, in order that they
can keep to their houses and avoid seeing her. When she leaves her
house some of her relations go up to the roof and again call out
the warning. At noon the widow, with her hair hanging loose, her
face uncovered, wearing a white robe and no ornaments, walks down
to one of the springs and bathes there. Anybody who meets or sees
her on the way is supposed to incur very bad luck indeed. After
this Lady Godiva-like progress, she hurries back to her house, puts
on her ordinary clothes, oils and dresses her hair and invites a
number of her women friends to a feast. She then begins to hope for
another husband.</p>

<p>The town-crier is a venerable, white-bearded<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span> individual whose family have
held the post for many generations. It is his duty to announce any
new regulations in the town, and to summon the populace to meetings
or to work. When an announcement has been proclaimed on three
consecutive days it is considered that everybody knows it, and if
after this an order is infringed the excuse of ignorance is not
entertained. The town-crier is a very necessary institution in a
place where scarcely anybody can read, and public notices are
therefore useless; his voice rivals the muezzin’s, and his drum
corresponds to the bell of the old style English bellman.</p>

<p>Funerals in Siwa are simple affairs. They generally take place
in the early afternoon and are attended by almost everybody in the
town. When a death occurs the women in the house raise the
deathwail, which is taken up in piercing accents by the women in
the other houses near, and then by the whole neighbourhood. It
sounds appalling, especially when it starts suddenly in the night.
The body is carried on a rough bier of olive wood, followed by a
long procession, the relatives, the sheikhs and notables, usually
riding on donkeys with umbrellas to shade them from the sun, and a
nondescript crowd of women and men. As the procession passes
through the streets the men chant a solemn dirge and the women
swing their veils in the air, throwing dust on their heads, and
every now and then joining in with shrill cries and wailings. On
arrival at the cemetery the women sit down some distance apart, and
the men proceed to the grave,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_223">[223]</span> reciting verses from the Koran. At twilight
the women collect again before the door of the deceased’s house and
continue the wailing, and afterwards the friends of the family are
entertained at a funeral feast where they eat and praise the
virtues of the dead person.</p>

<p class="cp1">THE TOWN CRIER’S DAUGHTER</p>

</div>

<p>There are several cemeteries round the town, some of them belong
to the easterners and some to the westerners. Almost all the roads
into the town cross burying-grounds. Until a few years ago it was
the custom to cover the grave with two split palm logs and a thin
layer of earth, which usually subsided, leaving nothing but wood on
the top. These old graves are still a source of danger, as often
when one rides over them, without knowing, the wood gives way.
Graves of sheikhs are distinguished by a roughly shaped headstone,
and generally a little heap of earthenware braziers, left by the
women who come to the cemetery and burn incense. When a
particularly religious or important Siwan dies, his family keep a
guard over the grave at night for about a fortnight after his
death, which they say is necessary to prevent the ghoulish old
witches from profaning it by digging up the corpse and stealing the
dead man’s hair and finger-nails for their charms.</p>

<p>The fear of the Evil Eye is almost more deeply rooted in Siwa
than in Egypt. It is thought that ill-disposed and jealous people
can cast a malignant influence over others, and also over animals
and inanimate objects. The Prophet Mohammed permitted the use of
charms against the Evil Eye,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_224">[224]</span> although he forbade them for any other
purposes. For this reason innumerable charms are worn and exhibited
by the Siwans; houses, gardens and olive presses are protected from
the much-dreaded curse by bundles of old bones, animals’ skulls, or
black earthenware pots stuck upside down and set along the roofs.
In many houses and in tombs an aloe plant is hung just inside the
entrance, swinging from the ceiling, which prevents any envious
person from doing harm. Special charms are made for animals by the
witches and the Fikis. The charm used to protect a donkey consists
of some ashes, a spider’s web, a little salt, and a scrap of paper
inscribed with a verse from the Koran, tied in a black bag and hung
round the animal’s neck. Some of the most valuable donkeys have
quite a cluster of amulets hung round them. The ingredients of the
various charms manufactured by the women are very similar to those
used by the witches in Macbeth, those that are the most difficult
to obtain being the most efficacious.</p>

<p>But in spite of innumerable precautions people are constantly
under the impression that they have incurred the Evil Eye, and then
complicated rites have to be performed in order to raise the curse.
This can be done in various ways. If the evil wisher is known his
victim follows him without being seen and collects a little sand
from his footprints which he takes to the Fiki. The Fiki, for a
small fee, recites certain verses over it, which removes the curse.
Another system is for the victim to go on a Friday, without
speaking to anybody on the way, to a male<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_225">[225]</span> date palm. He pulls off some of the
stringy, brown fibre and brings it back to the Fiki who twists it
into a cord and binds it round the man’s head. The patient keeps
this on his head during the day, and in the evening he again visits
the Fiki who unties the cord and reads some appropriate passages
from the Koran, after which the object is no longer in danger.
There is another method which is frequently practised in more
serious cases. The Fiki takes a hen’s egg—presumably a fresh
one—and inscribes certain cabalistic signs upon it. He then burns a
great deal of incense and mutters charms; when the patient has
become thoroughly bewildered he takes the egg and moves it seven
times round the victim’s head. He then breaks it in a basin, gazes
fixedly at it, discovers whose is the Evil Eye, and destroys its
power by scattering it on the floor.</p>

<p>Any individual who was popularly supposed to possess an Evil Eye
was carefully avoided. There was one old woman who was particularly
feared on this account. She was quite old and rather mad, but she
certainly had an exceptionally evil expression, and she showed her
face more than most of them. Anybody who met her in the morning,
starting out to his garden or on some expedition, would attribute
any mishap that occurred during the day to her malevolent
glance.</p>

<p>The witches of Siwa live among some ruined houses in the highest
part of the old town. Their leader is a little blind woman who is
said to be 100 years old. She looks exactly like one of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> shrivelled
mummies that are found in some of the tombs near Siwa, but her
scanty wisps of hair are dyed red which gives a most sinister
effect. She creeps about leaning on a staff, like the regular witch
in Grimm’s fairy tales, and although she is quite blind she manages
to slip about the high battlements like a lizard, knowing by force
of habit every stone in the place. When a client wishes to consult
her he comes after nightfall to a certain place among the ruins
high up in the town, where a number of dark passages converge, and
then he calls her. She lives somewhere up above with two or three
others. She mystifies her visitors by appearing suddenly, quite
close to them, noiselessly and apparently from nowhere.</p>

<p>I once sent a message saying that I should like to make her
acquaintance. One night after dinner I walked over to the town,
taking a man with me who knew the place well. We scrambled up and
up, through pitch-dark passages to the highest part of the town and
eventually arrived at a little low door about 4 feet high, in one
of the narrowest and steepest tunnels. After knocking several times
it was opened. I lit a match and saw the little old woman herself.
She led me up several more dark flights of steps to the roof of the
house, and there, sitting in the moonlight, I drank tea with her.
The tea was served by her grandchild, a Sudanese boy. Unfortunately
I could hardly understand a word she said, but the tea was
excellent, and the view was very fine.</p>

<p>It was a hot summer night, but the high roof was<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> cool with even a faint breeze
blowing across it. Looking down over the parapet one saw
white-wrapped, sleeping figures on the roofs below, and in the
distance there sounded the faint, mysterious melody of reed pipes
and a tom-tom. These Libyan nights are very wonderful; the sky is a
deep, dark blue, powdered with myriads of stars, and every few
minutes a long-tailed meteor flashes downwards. Shooting stars are
said to be hurled by the angels in heaven at the jinns on the earth
below, but the Siwans fear them as they say that each star kills a
palm tree. They prove this statement by arguing that when a tree
dies in a natural way it withers from the bottom, but when it
withers from the top, as many do, it is caused by a falling
star.</p>

<p>When a Siwan girl thinks that it is about time that she was
married, and no suitors are forthcoming, she adopts the following
custom. On a Friday, when the muezzins on the mosques are calling
the Faithful to pray at noon, she leaves the house, carrying some
sugar in her right hand and a little salt tightly clutched in her
left hand. She covers her face with her long, grey shawl and
hurries through the streets, avoiding everybody, to a little hill
outside the town—close to the Camel Corps barracks—which is crowned
by the tomb of a very venerated Siwan sheikh. When she arrives she
runs seven times round the tomb, eating the sugar and the salt and
calling on the sheikh to help her. She does this on three Fridays
in succession, and after that somebody comes to her parents and
asks for her hand. Later, if she<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_228">[228]</span> has a child, she distributes food to the
poor at the tomb of the sheikh as a thank-offering. The actual tomb
of Sheikh Abu Arash is inside a little whitewashed mud building.
The tomb is covered with white linen, which is renewed by devotees
of the saint, and a number of ostrich eggs, brought many years ago
from the Sudan, are suspended from the ceiling. Sometimes women
bring flowers and palm boughs and lay them on the tomb. Often on a
Friday I have noticed a woman hurrying round it, muttering
earnestly to herself and hoping for a husband. I wondered at one
time whether the proximity of the Camel Corps barracks had anything
to do with this recipe for obtaining a husband—but the belief has
been held for many years, long before the Camel Corps were thought
of.</p>

<p>Another way of obtaining a husband is as follows. The girl
summons one of the “wise women” to her house and provides her with
a basket, which is, by the way, a perquisite. The old woman takes
the basket and goes round to each mosque in the town collecting a
handful of dust from the ground immediately in front of each door.
She then brings the basket full of dust back to the girl and they
mix it with olive oil, making a kind of putty. The girl then brings
in a round tin or a large round dish and takes a bath, using the
putty as soap. The old woman carefully collects the water which has
been used in an earthenware pitcher. She goes out at night again to
each mosque and sprinkles a little of the water round the doors.
The next day, when the men come in and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_229">[229]</span> out of the mosques they tread on the place
where the water was poured, and probably some of the mud sticks to
their feet. One of them is sure to demand the girl in marriage.
There are various other methods of attaining the same ends; amulets
and charms are manufactured by the witches, which are supposed to
attract a certain man, especially if the ingredients of the charm
include something that once belonged to him. The whole idea is very
much the same as the system of love philtres and charms that were
used in Europe in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The witches are supposed to be able to summon jinns whenever
they want to, but any ordinary person has to follow out a
complicated proceeding before being able to do so. The system used
for invoking jinns is only practised secretly, and by women, but it
is implicitly believed in by everybody. For forty-five days the
woman eats no meat, feeding entirely on bread, rice, lentils and
fruits. Every evening she bakes a loaf of wheaten bread, unsalted
and flavoured with red pepper, which is the favourite flavouring
among jinns. She takes the loaf, naked, with her hair hanging
loose, to the rubbish heap outside her house, where she leaves it.
On the forty-fourth night a jinn appears in the form of some
familiar animal: a camel, donkey, or cow. If the woman is afraid it
kills her at once, but if she is brave, and speaks to it, it does
her bidding. The jinn tells her to prepare a dinner on the
following night for six of his brothers. Next day she makes six
loaves and flavours them with spiders’ webs besides pepper,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span> takes them out
to the dust heap as before. She leaves them and returns an hour
later. Then she finds the chief of the jinns, Iblis himself,
waiting for her, a monstrous creature with flaming eyes, horns and
great hooked teeth, breathing out fire from his mouth. This
individual asks her what she desires and promises to carry out her
wishes on the condition that from henceforth she never utters the
name of Allah.</p>

<p>There is another even more fantastic story that sometimes at
midnight one of the witches swings a cord from her house on the
battlements to the top of the tall minaret of a mosque just below.
She then steps off the wall and walks along the rope, which is
suspended in mid-air, like a tight-rope dancer. People also assert
that it is a practice of the witches to creep out into the
graveyards at night, to dig up a body, tear off the head, and carry
it back in their mouths like animals. This gruesome habit was
ascribed to werewolves in the olden days.</p>

<p>Often when there is a case of theft in the town one of the “wise
women” is summoned to help discover the thief and the whereabouts
of the stolen property. She occasionally finds the property, but
very rarely exposes the culprit. One day a rich merchant came to my
office in a great fuss and complained that a quantity of silver
ornaments belonging to his wife had disappeared from his house. I
held an official inquiry, but there were no clues, and nothing was
found out. Then the merchant invited the help of an old woman
called Marika, who according to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_231">[231]</span> popular opinion was assisted by a familiar
jinn. He offered her a substantial reward if she could trace the
jewellery. About a week later Marika came to the merchant and asked
him to collect every single person in his household outside the
door of the house at a certain time that night. The door was closed
on the empty house and the old woman hobbled up and down outside it
for about ten minutes, muttering incantations and watched with
considerable awe by the whole household. After this proceeding she
flung open the door and led the merchant to one of the lower rooms
where the missing ornaments were found lying on the floor near the
window. She explained that a jinn had brought them back; the
merchant paid her a reward and she then retired. Nobody thought of
trying to discover who had replaced the stuff, and my suggestion
that the lady herself had some knowledge of the culprit was
indignantly dismissed. These old women have access to all the
harems and have a considerable influence over the women, so they
are able to collect an enormous amount of information which helps
them in affairs like these, though they are by no means always so
successful.</p>

<p>If a number of people are implicated in a theft another very
curious system is used for discovering the culprit. A smooth, round
dish, or a flat, round piece of wood about the size of a plate is
produced and inscribed with curious hieroglyphics and verses from
the Koran. Two men, one of them who has to be an expert, sit down
on the ground facing each<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_232">[232]</span> other, holding the dish in the air about a
foot from the ground, balanced on the tips of their fingers. Each
of the suspects come in one by one and places a scrap of paper or
rag on the middle of the round piece of wood. If they are innocent
nothing happens, but when the guilty man has dropped his piece of
paper on to it the wood begins to revolve. I have seen this
performance done three times; on two occasions nothing happened,
but the other time the wood certainly did move round, although I
could not see how it was manipulated.</p>

<p>Divination, which is considered to be a form of satanic magic
among good Mohammedans, is much practised at Siwa. Perhaps it is
the idea of oracular communication which has lingered in the oasis
since the days when Siwa was famous for its oracle. Its most
frequent form is the interpretation of dreams, but future events
are also discovered by examining certain bones in animals that are
slaughtered for food, in a similar manner to the Roman augeries.
The lines on certain bones of a sheep denote coming events. One old
man, after examining the thigh bone of a young kid, announced to me
that ten men and six camels would arrive on the morrow from
Jerabub, and also that a large convoy was moving from the coast to
Jerabub. Part of the prediction turned out to be true, but I expect
that he found out about the camels before he made the prophecy.</p>

<p>The interpretation of dreams is considered the most reliable
guidance of this kind. When a man<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_233">[233]</span> has a difficult problem to decide he pays
fees to a Fiki and gives him some small article that belongs to
him. The Fiki takes the article, a cap for instance, and goes to
the tomb of Sidi Suliman or another sheikh; he prays and then lies
down and sleeps. Afterwards he interprets his dream as an answer to
his client’s questions. Sometimes he has to visit the tomb many
times before being able to give any advice, so in an urgent case
this system would not be a success. The art of divination at tombs
is hereditary, and there is a kind of code which attaches definite
meanings to certain things that the man dreams about. The ancient
Berbers who believed in an after life consulted at the graves of
their chiefs in a similar manner.</p>

<p>One of the Fikis, an old man who has performed the Pilgrimage
four times, is an expert fortune-teller. His methods are many, but
his favourite one seems to be a complicated system by which he
draws a species of chart in the sand or on paper, with a number of
little squares or “houses” which he fills in with figures depending
on his client’s birth date. He has other ways of working with sand
alone, or by opening a certain Arabic book on necromancy at random,
and reading from the page at which he happens to open it. The
natives have great faith in him, and say that his predictions are
very accurate—but this was not my opinion when I once consulted him
as an experiment.</p>

<p>When there is an epidemic in Siwa, such as the “Spanish
Influenza” which carried off an enormous<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_234">[234]</span> proportion of the population in 1918, a
ceremony takes place which must have originated when the Berbers of
Siwa made sacrifices to appease their gods. The wealthy men of the
town subscribe together and buy a young heifer. For several days it
is allowed to roam about feeding as it likes in anybody’s garden.
On an appointed day the people assemble in the square before the
tomb of Sidi Suliman, and the heifer is brought forward and
decorated with wreaths and flowers. It is then led seven times
round the walls, followed by a procession of the sheikhs and a band
of men and boys playing on cymbals, drums and pipes. It is led to
the gate of the principal mosque, Gama el Atik; a man steps forward
and slits its right ear with a knife, drawing blood, and then
throws the knife away. Afterwards the butchers slaughter it,
cutting up the meat into innumerable minute pieces and distributing
it so that each household in Siwa has one small piece. The people
take the scraps of meat home and hang them up in their house, and
this, so they say, has the effect of removing any plague or disease
that affects the town. Herodotus describes almost the same ceremony
as being a custom among the ancient Libyans.</p>

<p>Every Mohammedan is supposed, once in his lifetime, to perform
the Pilgrimage to Mecca. But only very few Siwans have enough money
to do this. Generally, every summer, two or three men go from Siwa,
taking with them a sum of money, the proceeds of the sale of dates
from certain trees which have been dedicated by their owners as
offerings to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
mosque at Mecca. Endowments of this description, either for the
support of a mosque or religious school, or for the giving of alms
to the poor on certain days in the year, are often made by wealthy
Mohammedans. A gift of this kind is called a “wakf,” and there is a
special branch of the Egyptian Government which deals with them,
but in Siwa the “wakfs” are administered by one of the sheikhs, and
this gives cause for a great deal of quarrelling and libels. The
pilgrims from Siwa carry the money with them, though it often
amounts to well over a hundred pounds, which among Arabs is a very
considerable sum, but the sanctity of their purpose protects them
from robbery. They generally accompany a caravan of Arabs going
direct to Alexandria, via the oasis of Gara.</p>

<p>On the day of their departure the whole town turns out to see
them off, escorting them to the most distant spring on the eastern
edge of the oasis. The wives of the pilgrims accompany them, and
when they arrive at the parting-point the following quaint ceremony
takes place. The crowd form up in the background, leaving the
pilgrims and their wives on an open space by the side of the
spring. A near relative takes from the wife of the pilgrim her
round silver bangles and rolls them along the ground, a distance of
about a hundred yards, to where the husband stands facing the east.
The wife, who on this occasion is dressed entirely in white, runs
along behind him and gathers up a little sand from each place where
the bracelets stopped rolling and fell to the ground.
She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> puts the sand
carefully into a little leather bag. After this she stands under a
certain very tall palm tree near the spring while the relative
climbs up and cuts off three long palm fronds which he gives to
her. After farewells have been said the caravan goes on its way,
the camels driven along in a bunch in front, followed by the Arabs
and the pilgrims; the wives and people return to Siwa, the women
wailing noisily, and the men beating tom-toms and singing. The
spring is about a mile beyond Aghourmi, and generally on that day
the sheikh of the village gives an entertainment and a luncheon to
some of the people.</p>

<p>On arrival at her house the wife of the pilgrim, with the women
of the family and one near male relation, goes up to the roof and
ties the three palm branches firmly to one corner; she puts the
sand into a little green linen bag and fastens it to the tips of
the three palm fronds, so that they bend towards the east—towards
Mecca. This ensures the pilgrim a safe journey and also serves to
let everybody know that the owner of the house is doing the
Pilgrimage.</p>

<p>In two months’ time it is supposed that the pilgrims have
reached Mecca. Their friends and relations have a feast on the roof
and hold a reading of the Koran. Then the man who rolled the
bracelets gets up and pierces the little green bag of sand so that
the contents pour out; he then turns the palm branches round and
fixes them in such a way that they point towards the west, in which
position they remain till the pilgrim returns safely home
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>When it is known
that the caravan has arrived at Ain Magahiz, or one of the outlying
springs, a crowd of men ride out to welcome the returned pilgrims,
but their women-folk stay at home, prepare a substantial meal, and
then go on to the roof, take down the palm branches and watch the
distant road for the cloud of dust that invariably announces a
caravan.</p>

<p>There is one festival in Siwa which almost corresponds to our
Christmas Day. It takes place in the winter, on the tenth day of
the month of January. For several days before Yom el Ashur—the
tenth day—the roofs of all the houses where there are children are
decorated with palm branches, 10 or 20 feet long, with a torch
soaked in oil fastened to each branch. After dark, on the eve of
the day, all the children go up on to the roofs and set light to
the torches. There is a blaze of illumination along the walls, and
for a few minutes the whole town is lit by the flaming torches. It
is a strange and beautiful sight, quite as effective as the most
elaborate illuminations. The children on each roof sing songs to
each other, and the wail of their voices sounds far on into the
night in a monotonous sweet refrain.</p>

<p>On the following day the children visit each other and exchange
presents which are very like “Christmas-trees.” Each child makes a
square framework of palm branches a few feet long, the white wood
is stained and dyed with coloured patterns, and on it are hung
fruits, nuts and sweets. Some of the richer children give each
other doves and rabbits, but generally they keep to sweets, the
most favourite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> kind
being pink and white sugared almonds which are imported by the
merchants from Cairo. The children of Siwa look forward to Yom el
Ashur with as much pleasure as their parents do to the annual
mulids. It is really a very attractive sight to see these little
Siwans, very clean and in fresh white clothes for the occasion,
trooping solemnly along the streets on their way to visit their
friends, while their papas sit outside their houses and chuckle at
them, and the mammas watch them proudly from an upstairs
window.</p>

<p class="dcap">SIWANS, on the whole, do not take life very
seriously, and when they have an excuse for an entertainment they
thoroughly let themselves go and are glad of an occasion, if they
can afford it, for a terrific gastronomic display, at which an
Englishman feels like a canary feeding among hungry ostriches. The
poor people eat twice a day, in the morning and evening; the meal
consists mainly of dates washed down by lubki and a few drops of
tea. They are very sociable, fond of talk, of entertaining their
friends and holding “fantasias,” but one notices very much the
entire absence of communion between sexes. Men hardly ever speak to
women in public, and it would be considered quite a scandal for
anyone to be seen in company with his own wife, almost worse than
if he was seen speaking to the wife of another man.</p>

<p>With the Arabs it is different. They meet about the camps, and
especially at the wells, which from<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_240">[240]</span> the time of Rebekah have been the scene of
many flirtations and courtships. The young men often go and sit by
the well-head watching the women drawing water, chaffing and
talking to them and, very occasionally, helping them to haul up a
heavy bucketful. I have often seen most amusing “goings-on” at a
well. Lifting up the weighty tins and drawing up the skins of water
gives the girls an opportunity for coquettish displays of neat arms
and ankles, but an infinitely more modest expanse is exhibited by
these Arabs than by the average young woman in England to-day. But
in Siwa if one rode past a spring where women were washing clothes
they would run off into the gardens as fast as they could, and even
when a Siwan man came to the pool they retired hurriedly with
shawls pulled over their faces, and waited some distance away.</p>

<p>In the hot summer evenings, when noises are hushed and the day’s
work is over, men sit in little groups outside their doors on low
mud benches, drinking tea, discussing the latest “cackle of the
palm-tree town,” and watching the piping shepherds driving their
flocks home from the grazing, raising clouds of golden dust as they
come along the sandy roads. The women collect on the roofs up
above, playing with their children and talking to each other. Each
sheikh sits before his house surrounded by a little crowd of
sycophants, sipping tea and adulation, and listening to the latest
scandal told about his rival of the opposite faction. Passers-by
are invited to join in, and if a stranger arrives there ensues
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> lengthy greeting
of much-repeated phrases, many hand-shakings, and polite
expressions. When one walked through the market-place after sunset
there would be a murmur of conversation from the shadowy white
figures sitting and lying round the doorways, who rose up and bowed
at one’s approach, and then sank down again silently. This Eastern
deference is very impressive at first, but it does not take long to
get accustomed to it.</p>

<p>In Siwa there is no lurid night life like that of Cairo, in
which novelists revel. The people go early to bed and lights are
very little used. Even the quarter of the women of the town is as
quiet as the other streets. There are no noisy cafes with music and
dancing girls, and no hidden houses where natives smoke hashish and
opium. The Senussi religion forbids smoking, or “drinking tobacco,”
as it is called, also coffee, which is supposed to be too
stimulating for the passions, and for this reason tea is the
universal drink. Life is a very leisurely affair, a pleasant
monotony, and “Bukra—inshallah!”—to-morrow, if God wills—is the
favourite expression. Very few games are played. Chess, which was
invented in the East, is unknown, but one sometimes sees a couple
of men deeply absorbed in a game called “helga,” which is rather
like draughts, played with onions and camel-dung on a board which
is marked out in the sand on the ground.</p>

<p>The younger men, especially the ones with black blood in their
veins, are much addicted to drinking lubki, an inexpensive,
intoxicating liquor made<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_242">[242]</span> from the sap of palm trees. The branches
that form the crown of the tree are cut off, leaving the heart of
the palm tree bare. A groove is cut from the heart through the
thick outer bark, and a jar is hung at the end of this groove which
receives the juice when it oozes up from the tree. A palm which has
been tapped in this way yields lubki for two or three months, and
if the branches are allowed to grow again after some time the tree
will continue to bear fruit, but the branches grow very ragged and
trees that have been used for lubki acquire a rather
drunken-looking appearance which always remains. One of the
favourite tricks of small Siwan boys is to climb up the palm trunks
and drink the lubki from the jar in which it is being collected by
the owner of the garden. When freshly drawn it is as sweet and
frothy as ginger-beer, but in a few days it becomes strongly
alcoholic and tastes bitter, like sour milk. Labourers working in
the gardens always retire to a spring and bathe after the day’s
work, then they enjoy a long “sundowner” of lubki before they ride
home to the town. All intoxicating drinks are forbidden by the
Koran, but in Siwa the people satisfy their consciences by saying
that the Prophet approved of all products of the palm tree, so
lubki cannot be a forbidden drink.</p>

<p>The Siwans are most particular in their religious observances.
There are a very large number of mosques in comparison to the
population, and Friday—the Mohammedan Sabbath—is very strictly
kept. On Thursday evening the prayers of the muezzins<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> are longer, as they remind the
people that the morrow is Friday. On Friday all the men visit the
mosques; no work is done in the gardens, and sometimes one of the
sheikhs distributes alms to the poor outside a mosque, or at the
tomb of one of his illustrious ancestors. For a long time before
the event the “mesakin” (poor) of the town collect at the place;
one sees old blind men, cripples, shrivelled hags, and ragged women
carrying solemn little babies, every one trying hard to appear the
most abjectly destitute, and therefore the most deserving case for
alms. Then the sheikh arrives, fat and prosperous, holding an
umbrella, and followed by some stout servants carrying huge bowls
heaped with cold boiled rice spotted with dark-coloured lumps of
camel flesh. The dishes are set down before the people, men and
women sitting apart, with a servant standing near each dish to keep
order and prevent free fights. The paupers snatch and claw at the
food, grabbing it with skinny, dirty fingers, squabbling fiercely
over yellowish-looking lumps of fat, shrieking vile abuse at each
other and trying to hide tasty scraps of meat in their clothes. The
sheikh looks on with a complacent smile and listens with much
gratification while his friends make audible remarks about his
excessive generosity and his liberal qualities.</p>

<p>The typical Arab sheikh of modern fiction (if he does not turn
out to be an Englishman) is a young, dashing, handsome and
intensely fascinating individual, well mannered and well washed;
but in real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> life
one rarely meets such a person—I myself have never seen him. The
typical sheikh at Siwa or on the Western Desert was elderly,
bearded and only moderately clean. Some of them were certainly very
fine-looking men, but utterly different to the personage that one
would expect from the descriptions in a certain style of popular
novel. The “guides” who swindle visitors in Cairo are much more
like the sheikh of fiction in appearance than are the real sheikhs
whom one meets and has dealings with on the desert.</p>

<p>One of the most curious, partly philanthropic institutions which
has survived in Siwa is the “Beit el Mal,” a public fund used for
providing shrouds for persons who die without money or relations,
and also for repairing mosques, causeways and sun-shelters. The
money is contributed from the sale of public land belonging to the
community, and also from the sale of argoul, which is a plant that
is used as manure, and rents for grazing paid by visiting Arabs.
The fund is collected and administered by certain sheikhs, and in
former days it included fines, inflicted as punishments, and taxes
on strangers who visited the oasis. Any case which is considered
deserving of charity is supplied from the money.</p>

<p>Ramadan, the Mohammedan Lent, the month in which the Koran was
supposed to have been sent down from heaven, is kept very strictly
in Siwa. During this month all good Mohammedans are expected to
refrain from the pleasures of the table, the pipe and the harem; no
morsel of food or drop<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_245">[245]</span> of water may pass their lips during the
day, but at night the revels commence and they feast and enjoy
themselves till the unwelcome approach of morning. Night is turned
into day, and at Siwa, during Ramadan, there is a continuous rumble
of drums from sunset till the early morning; at first it is
disturbing, but one grows accustomed to it before the month is
out.</p>

<p>The words of the Koran are:</p>

<p class="space-above15">“Eat and drink until ye can plainly
distinguish a black thread from a white thread by the daybreak;
then keep the fast until night.”</p>

<p class="space-above15">It is possible to obtain a dispensation
from keeping Ramadan, on medical grounds, and among the effendi
class I noticed that this was frequently done; travellers are also
excused from observing it, though I have often been out on trek
during Ramadan with men who were strictly fasting. If the month
occurs in the hot weather it is a very great strain on every one.
Siwa, in the daytime, during Ramadan, is like a dead place; the
minimum amount of work is done in the gardens, everybody stays
indoors during the day, and one sees nobody about the streets
except in the cool of the early morning and after sunset. Fasting,
especially abstaining from drinking, is a severe strain; the
sheikhs, when they come to the Markaz, look thin and ill, and one’s
servants make the fast an excuse for doing nothing.</p>

<p>This arduous month is terminated by a festival lasting for three
days known as the Minor Festival or<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_246">[246]</span> Kurban Bairam. It is celebrated with great
festivities and rejoicings in Egypt; servants expect tips and every
one appears in new clothes, but in Siwa it is not so important an
occasion; the people merely take a rest after the trials of the
fast month, reserving all their energy and money for the great
local mulid which occurs a week or so later. The mulid of Sidi
Suliman, the anniversary of the birth of Siwa’s patron sheikh, is
the most important incident of the whole year. The festival
generally lasts for three days, but the people take three more days
to recover from it. All the year round everybody saves money in
order to make a “splash” at the annual mulid.</p>

<p>For several days the women are busy cooking cakes and sweets;
the best fruit in the gardens is carefully watched over to be ready
at the mulid, and certain animals are fed up with a view to being
slaughtered. If possible one or two camels are bought from the
Arabs and kept at grass till they are fat enough to kill. On the
eve of the feast there is a general spring cleaning of the town.
The tombs of the sheikhs are freshly painted with whitewash,
carpets and coloured blankets are hung from every roof, while the
houses are swept and cleaned, and the place looks quite gay with
its clean white tombs, and bright mats and rugs hanging out from
roofs and windows. In the evening the sheep that are to be
slaughtered on the morrow are led in from the fields, and everybody
discusses with interest how many animals Sheikh So-and-So is going
to kill. Sometimes the richest men kill as many as seven or eight
sheep, and this is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
remembered and often mentioned to their credit, all through the
year. One year there was a great scandal in the town because Sheikh
Mohammed Hameid had boasted to everybody that he had killed six
sheep, but one of his household let out that there had only been
three old goats slaughtered. Enormous supplies of lubki are drawn
before the holiday in order that it may stand long and become
really strong.</p>

<p>On the morning of the mulid everybody puts on his best clothes,
and even the poorest labourer dons a new shirt or a clean jibba.
Every man goes to pray in his own particular mosque, and the women
visit the tombs and lay palm branches on the graves of their
relations. After this people retire to their houses and eat an
enormous meal and as much meat as they can possibly swallow. When
the men have eaten, the remainder of the food is sent to the harem,
and when the harem have finished, it is sent out to the servants
and labourers who pick the bones clean. After this heavy meal and
during the two following days everybody calls on everybody else,
and on this occasion one may see eastern sheikhs riding haughtily
through the western quarter to call on their much-detested
neighbours. In all the streets one meets the sheikhs riding along
on their best donkeys, wearing gorgeous silk, coloured robes, which
emerge from the chests in which they are locked up during most of
the year, each followed by an escort of servants. The people let
each other know at what time they will be “at home” and when they
will ride out visiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>On arriving at
the house one finds servants waiting to hold the donkeys, and if
one is so indiscreet as to look up at the little windows numbers of
female heads pop out of sight. The owner of the house is found
seated in his largest room, with the best carpets covering the
floor, surrounded by about a dozen little tables with dishes of
peaches, grapes, figs, melons, nuts, cakes and sweets, and one dish
which contains the young, white pith of a palm tree, which is much
esteemed as a delicacy. Along the side of the room there are more
dishes, covered with napkins, heaped up with meat, generally
smothered by a cloud of flies. The host offers tea, coffee, or an
exceedingly disagreeable syrupy liquor made from a species of fruit
“syrop” which should be taken cold with soda, but is served hot
like tea, according to Siwan fashion. Strict etiquette enjoins that
one must drink three cups of tea or coffee, and taste every dish in
the room, except the meat, which is reserved for the family at each
house.</p>

<p>The extra amount of food everywhere attracts swarms of flies,
and the sticky smell of fruit and meat is rather overpowering, when
the temperature is about 106 degrees in the shade. One year I rode
round myself and paid calls, but the next time I was wiser and
invited the sheikhs and notables to a light meal at the Markaz,
after their own solid luncheon, and even then, although showing
post-prandial symptoms, they managed to eat very heartily. It was
at one of these entertainments that I learnt that the Siwans have
special names for people who offend<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_249">[249]</span> against the strict etiquette of eating. The
following are all highly condemned:</p>

<p class="hang2 space-above15">The man who turns round and looks to
see whether more is coming.</p>

<p class="hang2">The individual who bites a piece of meat and
replaces it in the dish.</p>

<p class="hang2">The person who blows on his food to cool it.</p>

<p class="hang2">The one who is undecided and fingers first one
piece, then the other.</p>

<p class="hang2">And finally the visitor who orders about his
host’s servants, which I have noticed myself as being a very common
habit.</p>

<p class="space-above15">In the afternoon of the mulid the younger
men and boys go out into the gardens, where they lie singing and
drinking lubki. At dusk the people begin to collect in the open
space below the highest part of the old town, round the square,
white tomb of Sidi Suliman, which is illuminated with candles and
lanterns, and ornamented with banners stuck along the parapet of
the roof. Crowds of men keep on passing up the steps and in and out
of the tomb, shuffling off their shoes at the entrance and praying
at the grave of the saint. Then everybody collects at his own
particular mosque, in various parts of the town, and a great
“zikr,” a kind of prayer-meeting and religious dance, is held
outside the Medinia mosque in the eastern quarter of the town. It
is a very wonderful sight, and is attended by four or five hundred
devotees.</p>

<p>There is a large, open space outside the mosque<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span> surrounded by tall houses,
whose little black windows look like gaping eyes, and behind them
one catches a glimpse of the tops of palm trees in some gardens
darkly silhouetted against the deep blue African sky. The whole
scene is flooded with brilliant moonlight, except where the cold,
black shadows fall from the high houses. The ground is entirely
carpeted with old rugs and mats whose faded colours show dimly in
the moonlight; along one side, in front of the mosque, sit the
sheikhs and notables of the Medinia sect, and on the other three
sides of the square there is a vast congregation of white-robed,
seated natives, row upon row of “dusk faces with white silken
turbans wreathed.” A carpeted space in the centre is kept
empty.</p>

<p>Among the shadows of the houses there are more blurred white
figures, and in one corner of the square kettles are being boiled
on open fires, and men in flowing robes walk to and fro across the
light from the flames. There is a subdued murmur of conversation.
The first part of the entertainment is a solemn tea-drinking.
Dozens of men move about, barefooted and silent, carrying trays and
distributing hundreds of little glasses of tea, which is made and
poured out by the sheikhs. After everybody has drunk three glasses
the low tables in front of the sheikhs are carried away, and the
audience becomes absolutely silent. Then the chief sheikh of the
Medinia mosque, a handsome, bearded man wearing the green turban,
whose looks belie his notoriously bad character, begins intoning
verses from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Koran in a sonorous, impressive voice, sitting on the carpet with
his hands spread on his knees. When he stops one of the other
sheikhs begins, until most of them have had a turn. After this
three men step into the space in the centre of the seated audience.
One of them is quite a boy with a very beautiful voice, the other
two are older men. They walk slowly round and round the square,
abreast, singing together a tune which resembles the solemn
grandeur of a Gregorian chant, and after each verse the whole
audience, several hundred powerful male voices, intone the refrain.
It is an intensely impressive performance and one feels thrilled at
being the only white man present at such a spectacle. The bright
moonlight shines down on the massed ranks of motionless natives
whose faces look black, much darker than they actually are, in
comparison with their white robes and white skull caps or turbans.
For a background there are the high houses, and on the roofs,
peering down at the square, a number of heavily veiled women, and
“over all the sky—the sky! far, far out of reach, studded with the
eternal stars.”</p>

<p>After some time everybody rises and all the full-grown men close
up and form a circle, tightly wedged together. The old sheikh steps
into the centre and begins repeating more prayers, quietly at first
then with restrained violence. The audience join in, chanting the
Mohammedan creed. Gradually the singing grows louder, the voice of
the sheikh is drowned, and the ring of white-robed men
begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span> swaying to
and fro, backwards and forwards, their voices become hoarse and
raucous; every man jerks to and fro in a frenzy of religious
excitement, and the prayer becomes a violent repetition of the word
“Allah—’la, ’la, ’la.” Then the sheikh who leads the prayer
gradually slows down, and the congregation repeat more quietly the
Mohammedan creed, “La ilahi illa—llah, wa Mohammed rasul
Allah”—there is no deity but God, and Mohammed the prophet of God.
The contrast between the performers at the beginning of the zikr,
when they are calm and grave, and at its close, when they are hot,
dishevelled and exhausted, is very remarkable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowd in the Sidi Suliman square increases. From
the various mosques come long processions of white-robed figures,
singing and carrying banners; the light of their torches and
lanterns flashes in and out as they slowly thread their way through
the steep, winding streets of the town, and their voices become
faint, then loud, as they pass through and out of the arches and
tunnels. They assemble in the square, forming large circles and
dancing zikrs. In one corner one sees a ring of old men singing and
clashing cymbals; in another group there are a dozen men banging
drums, while a half-naked young negro in their midst twirls rapidly
round and round, then suddenly falls to the ground and rolls over
and over till he reaches the tomb itself, where he is lifted up by
his admiring and applauding friends and carried away unconscious.
Behind the tomb there are fires where the drums<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span> can be warmed, in order to
tighten their parchment. Numbers of women squat on the outskirts of
the crowd, huddled in their dark robes, hardly visible, except when
the moon gleams on their silver ornaments and pale white faces.
Some of them are burning incense in little earthenware braziers,
and occasionally one of them creeps up to the white tomb and kisses
the wall, if she can reach it before being driven off by the
ghaffirs—watchmen.</p>

<div class="figcenterplate iw6">
<figure id="i22"><img src='images/i22.jpg' alt=''>
<p class="cp1">A “FANTASIA” AT THE TOMB OF SIDI SULIMAN</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The dancers in the centre of the circles move faster, keeping
time to the drums and hand-clappings of the audience, and soon
everybody is swaying to and fro. Away in the gardens outside the
town there are flickering lights and a sound of singing. The great
zikr before the Medinia mosque ceases and all the people come
streaming out from the dark, shadowy lanes towards the tomb of Sidi
Suliman, which shines white in the moonlight with orange lights
blazing from its open door and little windows. The sheikhs walk
slowly about from group to group, each followed by a little knot of
men—servants carrying carpets and cushions, and some watchmen in
tall brown tarbouches, holding staves. The police stand about in
the crowd, and when one walks up to watch a dance they hurry
forward and push people aside, saying, “Make way, make way!” The
sound of distant singing in the gardens grows louder and nearer,
and suddenly mobs of men and boys, mad with drink, half naked, come
leaping and shrieking into the square, scattering fire from their
blazing torches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>Then drums are
beaten madly, cymbals crash, and the shrill screech of reed pipes
rends the air. The crowd forms into a great circle round the mass
of frenzied dancers who career round, drinking as they dance,
shouting and yelling. In the centre there are a dozen men lashing
away at cymbals and tom-toms. One of the dancers is an enormous
blind giant, almost naked, who flourishes a jug of lubki, and some
of the boys have wreaths round their heads and bunches of flowers
stuck behind their ears.</p>

<p>As the night goes on the pandemonium becomes wilder; the exotic
timbre of the music grows more frenzied; many of the dancers throw
off their robes, and great pitchers full of potent lubki are
distributed among the people. The fires in the square, heaped up
with rushes, blaze more brightly when the honey-coloured moon sinks
behind the high walls of the town, and frantically writhing figures
are seen whirling round by the light of the shooting flames and
torches. The whole scene becomes even more <em>macabre</em>.
Gradually boys and men among the audience, fascinated by the mad
mob of dancers, plunge in among them, linking arms and revolving
round the musicians in the centre, crouching, jumping, hopping, and
running, each one executing strange steps and postures as he goes
along. Sometimes the music is voluptuous and alluring, then the
dance becomes frankly indecent; at other times it is wild and
furious, and the performers seem to be overcome with savage
transports of rage; but the whole time the music has a very
definite rhythm which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_255">[255]</span> urges them on. The light of many torches
gleams on glistening black flesh and shining teeth and eyes; the
air is thick with heavy fumes of incense, and the bitter smell of
liquor. On the outskirts of the crowd one sees figures stretched
like corpses on the ground, overcome with the orgy of drink and
dancing. When the faint light of dawn shows in the sky, and the
fires are dying down they begin to tire of the Bacchanalian revels,
and one by one the dancers fall exhausted to the ground, lying
where they fell, or crawl away, staggering through the silent
streets, to sleep off the effects in readiness for the following
day. Looking down on to this riotous African carnival from the
highest roofs of the town one can imagine oneself, like Dante,
watching damned souls writhing in hell.</p>

<p>The Siwans are extremely fond of music and singing. Their
instruments are crude and simple, but they manage to obtain a
surprising amount of music from them. Drums, or tom-toms, are of
various kinds, either cylindrical gourds or basins with a skin
stretched across one end, or large round tambourines with parchment
covers. By striking first the side of the drum and then the
resounding parchment, two different sounds are obtained, one hard,
the other soft, and this again can be varied by using either the
palm of the hand or the clenched fist. Flutes are usually made from
the barrels of long Arab guns, or occasionally from reeds, and
string instruments, like primitive guitars, are manufactured from a
bowl covered with skin, a wooden frame, and string made from wire
or gut which can be tightened or slackened.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_256">[256]</span> The combination of these simple
instruments with human voices is singularly effective.</p>

<p>There is a similarity in all African music; in fact, all Eastern
music is somewhat alike. The melody is monotonous and barbaric:
sometimes a song sung in a tremulous, high-pitched voice which
rises above the throbbing tom-toms, or a tune played on a shrill
flute with an accompaniment of drums and twanging string
instruments. The scale ranges from bass to treble, sometimes short,
sad notes, and sometimes long drawn-out wails, varied by sudden,
unexpected pauses. It is difficult to describe, but the general
effect is somewhat sinister, at the same time very fascinating. To
a stranger it may sound like an inharmonious wail, but in time one
gets to appreciate the subtle undercurrent of half-notes which
makes the melody. It is suggestive of fierce passions, vague
longings, and vast desert spaces.</p>

<p>The characteristic song of the Western Arabs, a dreamy refrain
with a reiterated note, which they sing to themselves as they ride
alone across the desert, is very similar to the Swiss yeodling; but
Siwan music is quite different. The Siwans have songs and tunes of
a distinct individual style. With them certain notes have definite
meanings; there is a language of sound. When some of their best
singers, usually boys, are performing, the listeners can interpret
the meaning of the song without needing to hear the words. They
sing everywhere, and at all times, especially when at work in the
gardens. Several men and boys working in different parts
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> a big palm grove
sing to each other, taking up the refrain and answering each other
back, and these unaccompanied quartets and trios sound very
attractive, especially when one hears them in the evening, now loud
and clear, now faintly in the distance. Good voices are much
esteemed, and the best singing boys are hired to perform at
entertainments. The songs that have words are in the Siwan
language, but when literally translated they are exceedingly
indecent.</p>

<p>Dancing, too, is very different to the fashion of the Arabs or
the Sudanese. In many parts of the Sudan one sees men and women
dancing together, and among the Arabs there are dancing girls who
perform in front of a mixed audience. On the Western Desert it is
not considered shameful for respectable women to dance, although
most of the best dancers are very decidedly not respectable. But in
Siwa only the men dance in public, and it is very difficult to see
women performing, but on one occasion I did see an entertainment of
this kind.</p>

<p>It took place at night in the courtyard of a house discreetly
surrounded by high, windowless walls. A space on the ground was
spread with carpets, with some cushions at one side, and the moon
shone down and illuminated the scene. A little wooden door in the
wall was pushed open and about a dozen girls, followed by an old
woman, and a small boy carrying a brazier of smoking incense,
shuffled into the court and squatted down in a line on one side.
The girls wore the usual Siwan dress, a blue striped<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> robe reaching below the knees,
and white silk-embroidered trousers; but besides this each of them
wore a long silk, coloured scarf, hiding her face and shoulders,
and a quantity of jingling silver ornaments and heavy bangles which
they took off and gave to the old woman to hold while they danced.
Three or four of them had small drums which they beat as they sang.
At first they sat in a row, very carefully veiled, singing quietly
to the accompaniment of the little tom-toms. Then one of them got
up, with the thin coloured veil hiding her face, and began to
dance, slowly at first, keeping time to the music, but gradually
moving faster as the music grew wilder. The dancing began by simple
steps and swaying gestures of the arms, then the movements became
more rapid, and one saw a confused mass of swirling draperies and
silver chains.</p>

<p>After each girl had danced for a few minutes the <em>motif</em>
of music changed, becoming more sensuous, and the <em>prima
danseuse</em> took the floor again. This time she performed a
variety of the <em>danse de ventre</em>, which consists of queer
quivering movements and swaying the body from the hips, keeping the
upper part still, with arms stretched down and painted hands
pointing outwards. This was varied by an occasional rapid twirl
which gave the audience a sight of the dancer’s features; a pale
face with long “kohl” tinted eyes and a scarlet painted mouth, set
in a frame of black braided hair, oiled and shiny. Finally, the
lilt of the music became even more seductive, and the dancer swung
off the long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
fringed, silk scarf and danced unveiled, swaying more violently,
with her arms stretched above her head, stamping on the ground in
time to the rhythm of the music, and finally subsiding into her
place in an ecstasy of amorous excitement.</p>

<p>It was not an attractive performance, although the dance is one
which is very much admired by natives, who consider it intensely
alluring. One sees it in various forms all over Africa, and
everywhere it is equally ugly and dull.</p>

"conc"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p class="dcap">MANY people have at various times carefully
considered the agricultural possibilities of Siwa from a commercial
point of view. Undoubtedly the cultivation in the oasis could be
greatly developed, as there is enough water to irrigate a much
larger area of ground than that which is now being cultivated. At
present the natives have only the most primitive ideas of
agriculture; for instance, they neglect most of the fruit trees by
doing no pruning, and through sheer laziness they have allowed
various species to die out completely. They are handicapped, too,
by having no proper tools or machinery. The dates of Siwa are
exceptionally fine, famous all over Egypt, and besides these there
is a quantity of other fruit whose quality could be much improved
by proper care. Olive oil is a valuable product and commands a very
high price on the coast and in Egypt. No wine is made from the
grapes, and no one has experimented in drying fruit, which is a
simple and lucrative industry.</p>

<p>But the difficulty that faces one in all commercial schemes is
the means of transport. Camels can only be hired from the coast at
rare intervals and during the season when the Arabs do not mind
visiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span> the oasis,
and their hire is so prohibitive as to make any heavy transport
hardly worth while. The ex-Khedive went to Siwa for the purpose of
seeing whether it would be worth running a light railway from the
coast to the oasis, and since then the project has been seriously
thought of more than once, but it has always been considered
impracticable on account of the expense and the great difficulty of
crossing such an expanse of waterless desert.</p>

<p>An alternative scheme of running a service of motor lorries is a
more likely proposition, and when once started it might be highly
remunerative. Some of the richest and most progressive Siwans were
very anxious to buy a lorry and send their olive oil direct to
Alexandria, but they failed to appreciate that one lorry alone
would be useless, and the minimum number would have to be four.</p>

<p>Apart from the possibilities of trade Siwa is valuable as a
field for excavators. So far very little digging has been done in
Siwa and the adjoining oases, and undoubtedly there are great
possibilities in this direction. Labour is cheap and one could hire
enough men in the place to do any work of this kind. Nobody has
attempted to locate and examine the subterranean passages which
connect Aghourmi and the temple, and Siwa town with the Hill of the
Dead. There is also the possibility of rediscovering the emerald
mines which brought fame to the oasis many centuries ago, and which
are now so completely forgotten that I doubt whether half a dozen
people have ever heard of their existence. Under the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> present regime, though one
does not know how long it will last, an Englishman can live at Siwa
in perfect safety, and though the climate is certainly very hot in
summer-time it is quite agreeable during more than half the
year.</p>

<p>But Siwa will never become a much-visited place, which is
perhaps all for the best, owing to the strip of desert which
stretches between it and the coast. Otherwise it might have
developed into another Biskra, which is the oasis in Algeria that
Hitchens describes so wonderfully in <em>The Garden of Allah</em>.
Quite lately I noticed in a travel book called <em>Kufara, the
Secret of the Sahara</em>, by Mrs. Rosita Forbes, a mention of this
very desert between Siwa and the coast which was described as a
“tame desert.” This expression, used by a lady with such great
knowledge of deserts in all parts of the world, surprised me—and I
own that it annoyed me! Her only experience of this particular
desert was acquired during the one day in which she motored up from
Siwa to Matruh in the company of several officers of the F.D.A. who
met her there. But people on the Western Desert can remember, only
too well, a terrible fatality which occurred less than a year ago
in which three Englishmen were involved, and which proved
conclusively that no waterless desert is safe or “tame,” even in
these days when cars can travel across it.</p>

<p>I was not actually in Siwa when Hassanein Bey arrived there,
accompanied by Mrs. Forbes, after their memorable journey to Kufra,
but I returned there soon afterwards, and it was very interesting
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span> hear of her
exploit from the various natives who came in to Siwa from the
west.</p>

<p>In spite of a climate that was sometimes trying, in spite of a
bad bout of fever, and in spite of an occasional feeling of
loneliness, the memory of the time that I spent at Siwa will always
be a very happy one. Siwa is so absolutely unspoilt, and so
entirely Eastern. Even the ubiquitous Greek trader has not
penetrated this desert fastness. It is a place that grows on one,
and the few who have been there, and who appreciate its curious
fascination, find it very hard to leave.</p>

<p>There is a saying in Egypt that whoever tastes the water of the
Nile must some time return there, and I am very sure that he who
drinks from the Siwa springs will always wish to go there again.
Walking by moonlight under those huge, towering battlements of the
strange old town, through streets and squares deserted save for an
occasional white-robed figure, one could almost credit the queer
stories of ghosts, jinns and afreets that are believed by the
Siwans to haunt every spot in this mysterious little oasis which
lies hidden among the great barren tracts of the pitiless Libyan
Desert.</p>
